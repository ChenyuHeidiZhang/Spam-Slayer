       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times. No dice.-This ANC issue happened on the original QC 35 too-google assistant initiated update WITHOUT prompting \"yes or no\". This happened when opening the app.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10.

I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses.

I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times.

While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music.

A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.

I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",

I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times. No dice.-This ANC issue happened on the original QC 35 too-google assistant initiated update WITHOUT prompting \"yes or no\". This happened when opening the app.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable.

This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear.

Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times. No dice.-This ANC issue happened on the original QC 35 too-google assistant initiated update WITHOUT prompting \"yes or no\". This happened when opening the app.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",

At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.

It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",

We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.

The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",

I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.

After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10.

These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

(As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times.

Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort.

Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things.

This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times. No dice.-This ANC issue happened on the original QC 35 too-google assistant initiated update WITHOUT prompting \"yes or no\". This happened when opening the app.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.

These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.

Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.

This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",

It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",

Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",

After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it.

I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times.

I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.

Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.

The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware.

They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices.

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times.

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.

These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself.

Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times. No dice.-This ANC issue happened on the original QC 35 too-google assistant initiated update WITHOUT prompting \"yes or no\". This happened when opening the app.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",

This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",

It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",

We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10.

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.

The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses.

It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times.

The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find).

I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two.

I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times. No dice.-This ANC issue happened on the original QC 35 too-google assistant initiated update WITHOUT prompting \"yes or no\". This happened when opening the app.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.

Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours.

These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself.

Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times. No dice.-This ANC issue happened on the original QC 35 too-google assistant initiated update WITHOUT prompting \"yes or no\". This happened when opening the app.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",

At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.

It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",

Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",

I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",

Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.

This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.

       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",

       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses.

Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times. No dice.-This ANC issue happened on the original QC 35 too-google assistant initiated update WITHOUT prompting \"yes or no\". This happened when opening the app.\\n            ',\n",

The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",

Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times.

       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2. When it comes down to the best noise-cancelling and the best comfort, there were a lot of debates between the two. And, when choosing headphones, I think it\\'s important to consider what you want in a pair of really expensive headphones.For me, comfort was an absolute priority. A lot of headphones can give users wearer\\'s fatigue and can become hot and uncomfortable after some time. When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",

The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels.

When I\\'m using them to study or through plane rides, I wanted to make sure that whichever pair I bought would be the most comfortable.In the end, I decided on Bose because of how light-weight they were. The Bose QC35 IIs are about 8.1oz (~230g) in weight and the Sony headphones are about 9.7oz (~275g). They might not seem like a huge difference, but that comparison is for you as a future consumer to make.So far, wearing the QC35 IIs have given me the best wearing experience out of any of the headphones I\\'ve tried previously. I can go hours with them on without feeling much discomfort and because they are so light-weight, sometimes I forget that they\\'re even on.What\\'s also great about these in particular is that these cover your entire ear. The plush for the L/R ears actually sits around your ears instead of sitting partly on your ears. When I tested the Sony headphones at Best Buy, the headphones sat partly on my ears and after ten minutes of testing them, I had the sense that they might become uncomfortable after some time. This was also one of the big reasons I chose to go with Bose instead Sony.The active noise cancelling is one of the best on the market today and personal experience tells me that the ANC is amazing, but plenty of reviews have said that Sony either matches or beats Bose in the ANC department. Because I don\\'t own a pair of the WH1000XM2, I can\\'t really comment on which is better. The QC35 IIs, however, blocks out nearly all ambient noises and is a pleasure to use in noisy environments. Some have said that the ANC can give them headaches due to a cabin-like pressure attributed to the ANC. It took a day or so to adjust to the ANC and that \"cabin-like pressure\" and it doesn\\'t bother me personally anymore, but so I would head to your local Best Buy or electronics store to test this for yourself. These headphones are a huge expenditure, so it\\'s important to test whether or not this might apply to you.Pros:Incredibly lightweight and comfortableCompletely surrounds your ear instead of sitting partly on top of your earsANC is amazing that blocks out all ambient noises20-hour battery lifeCons:\"Cabin-like pressure\" that may cause headaches for some usersSound quality may not be up to far for some audiophiles (some reviewers have noted that Sony has better sound quality)TLDR:If comfort is your top priority and you\\'re not the biggest audiophile, I would absolutely recommend Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"I have now had two of these sets of headphones and am in the process of returning the second. I'm writing this review in comparison to a set of Plantronics BB Pro 2 headphones that were separately connected to the same devices as this Bose headset, so the issue is definitely the headset and not the device.First device:- Noise cancelling worked sometimes in one ear, sometimes in both, and sometimes in neither.- The headset would randomly emit a death screech at maximum volume in one ear.After returning the first device, I thought that there was no chance I'd get a defective product twice in a row. I was wrong.Second device:- In a 15 minute period, I experienced 4 random power flickers which resulted in the device power cycling, announcing battery level, and reconnecting to the device it lost connection to.I'm really disappointed with the quality level of these considering they are a ~300$ premium device. Hitting 1 quality issue happens, but two devices in a row is absurd. In contrast, I've had my other noise cancelling set for years and it has no issues. It's unfortunate as this device has a lot of positives (good battery, great sound, easy to use, nice carrying case and compact fold pattern) but none of them matter if the device doesn't work. 1 star.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'Sound and noise canceling seemed very good. However these were a nightmare to get bluetooth connected properly. My wife wanted them for the computer when working and TV in the evening. Could not get them to seamlessly switch between devices with out having to clear the bluetooth connections and starting over.Then once connected the bluetooth kept breaking up, dropping and stuttering if she moves even 12 feet from the TV or computer. 19 dollar cheap headphones with poor sound quality work much better than this.For this kind of money, no thank you.  Sent them back.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a \"9\" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you\\'re playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn\\'t do very much at all. It does let you \"find your headset\" similar to the \"find my phone\" app, and it will apply firmware. (I\\'m hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don\\'t think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped  the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it\\'s less annoying on the top of the head.  (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I\\'m familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'These are amazing and Bose is great!  I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities.  I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted.  I don\\'t even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department.  I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients.  The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well.  Battery life is extremely good.  I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset.  It comes with an 1/8\" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead.  An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time.  This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device.  It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn\\'t function.  Bose support was difficult to deal with.  At first the support technician didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with the headset.  After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer.  This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks.  The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall.  I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there.  After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set.  No other questions asked.  He just said \"We like to take care of our customers\".  I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I received these with firmware 2.0.1 which worked phenomenally with my Mac and iPhone. ANC was nice and bluetooth stable. Unfortunately, the google assistant app decided to update my firmware to 2.5.1 by it self!! Seriously Google? Ask me for permission first.Afterwards, ANC got noticeably worse. I played various background noise on my speakers and there was no difference between low and high ANC. Bluetooth skipped every 2 seconds if both Mac and iPhone were connected whereas it worked seamlessly before. Symptoms didn\\'t go away after updating to the 3.1.8 firmware via Bose\\'s website. These are getting returned.If you get these headphones, DO NOT update them - please. If it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it.Notes:-I did the Bose reset and re-paired multiple times. No dice.-This ANC issue happened on the original QC 35 too-google assistant initiated update WITHOUT prompting \"yes or no\". This happened when opening the app.\\n            ',\n",
       " \"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.\\n            \",\n",
       " 'For $384 each, you would think this is top-of-the-line.  I saw the many 1 star ratings and think that they guys are just overly critical.  But I was shocked that after 2 weeks of perfect use, my headsets start to disconnect by itself from my phone.  It would re-boot the connect, the headset audio would say \"Bluetooth Disconnected.  Bluetooth Connected.\"  I cannot carry on a phone call, not a song, not anything without this continual interruptions and disconnects.  A cheap bluetooth $20 headset will lock in a connection solidly for an eternity.  But this expensive Bose is horrible on this essential feature.Comfort, material, design, construction, performance, ... all fine.  Other than the fact that it connect connect to my device for more than a few minutes long before auto-disconnecting the bluetooth.  I search everyone on the web, but there\\'s no solutions to be found.  There are thousands of instances of this occurring everywhere on this product.  Check out the 1-star ratings on Amazon and you\\'ll see what I am describing here.  After 2 headsets with 100% failure, I know this is not a fluke.  This flaw is built-in and designed into the headset hardware/firmware/software.I called Bose Tech support.  They took me through a process to turn off the headset for 30 seconds, plug it in to the charger for 5 seconds, then unplug from USB charger and turn on again. This is very rudimentary.  I have unpair, rebooted device, drained the headset battery, reloaded the Bose App, resynch to my phone many times, airplane mode, turned off bluetooth, tried on different phones, computers tablets, ... in the end, it all fails.Bose Tech support was good, though.  They offered to replace, but I don\\'t think that\\'s the problem.  I just want their engineer to get all-hands-on-deck and fix this serious problem on such an expensive product.\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very \"clean\" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as \"calming\". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don\\'t expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.)  than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn\\'t play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can\\'t connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is  most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...\\n            ',\n",
       " 'I didn\\'t buy these headphones through Amazon but I thought I would leave a review for these anyway.When I was shopping for a quality pair of noise-cancelling headphones, it really came down to a few choices. Watching a lot of youtube reviews and reading a lot of online reviews, it narrowed down to choosing the Bose QC35 IIs and the Sony WH1000XM2.
