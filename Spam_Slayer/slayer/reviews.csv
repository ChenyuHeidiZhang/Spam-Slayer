3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very dense and wordy. I thought the formatting was weird and hard to distinguish quickly at a glance what was introducing or motivating a new topic vs the worked examples for that section. Needed more distinct separation imo. Content wise it was adequate and the examples were good and diverse, however I am certain there are better introductory probability texts.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ignore the negative reviews. This IS the best textbook in the market for an introduction to probability for math undergraduates. Why? Glad you asked.1. Coverage of topics. It shows that the authors are also top researchers in the field. The theorems, examples, and exercises are chosen with a purpose. They know what's important to make advances in modern probability and what's old-fashioned. They are building a solid foundation on which students can develop more advanced probability.2. Rigor. Theorems and proofs are presented with adequate rigor. They explain as much as possible and present possible pitfalls (such as measure theoretic details) and hint at how to solve them.3. Probabilistic ideas. The proofs are presented with probabilistic ideas. I suspect this is the primary reason why some students find it difficult. They have never been exposed to probabilistic way of thinking. But this is what the textbook is supposed to train them. And it does it flawlessly.4. Statistical ideas. The book has plenty of statistics in it, for example, discussion on p-values. This is great. Plenty of probability concepts can be best communicated through statistical questions. If you have math and stat students in your class, they both get a lot out of it.I am so grateful to the authors for writing this textbook. This is miles ahead of any other textbook I have seen. We have adopted this book for our undergrad probability sequence successfully.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not the book you want to use to study for your class even though it is used for your class.The definitions, theorems or even examples are not really helpful to get an idea about the topics covered.Unlike many other good math textbooks, you will not get a clear understanding about the whole topics covered and will be more confused after reading. It's explanations are horrible and more confusing with vague symbols and letters. Professors find it hard to understand. Hilarious how it is for the basic Introductory and is so difficult to understand.The authors did terrible job with wording and sentence fluency so that it is understandable to them only but not to any others

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used a draft version of this book while in Prof. Seppalainen's class. This book writes an equation and then translates it into English. In a way, this book is why I can say I understood probability theory or math in general. It also got me over the notion that theoretical math isn't fun; it converted an engineer into a mathematician.I sincerely recommend this book! The examples were engaging and well-explained, and wherever there was an unintuitive step taken, it was expanded upon immediately after. I read this book cover to cover, and I thoroughly enjoyed every page, which I cannot say about any other textbook.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted a small device that played my music and that I could carry around with me in the house or outside in the garden. I was looking at devices that cost almost $200.00 and at the last minute changed my mind after I spoke with a friend who recommended I get a Bluetooth compatible device. So I went on Amazon and began looking for such a product when I saw OontZ Angle 3 product with, get this, 35,000 reviews.........that's not a typo...35,000 reviews. OK that was amazing but then I saw the price $25.99. I thought that MUST be a mistake! I also thought how good could this product be for $25.99 but I also thought if that many people liked this item then I should order it and see. WOW, I loved it and after 4 days ordered ANOTHER for my wife with the Blue color (it comes in 5 colors). The sound is wonderful with a lovely bass, I can be up to 100 feet and still have a Bluetooth connection, it is so simple to use has twin speakers and is less than 6 inches long. Cambridge Products has hit a grand slam with this product and its price point. Go out and buy it...................its that good.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just opened the box - When it comes to quality sound from small speakers I am very skeptical. Distortion and flat sound is typical from tiny speakers - well I have been proven wrong - today's technology is truly amazing. After several months of research into bluetooth portable speakers I finally pulled the trigger on this awesome speaker from Cambridge Soundworks and my mind, and ears - are just blown away.The Oontz 3 is a small 12 hour battery or wall powered Bluetooth stereo speaker with AMAZING CLARITY and BASS - even played at high volume there is NO DISTORTION  - simply fills the room and crystal clear sound - you can answer phone calls, use direct AUX in and even take it into the shower with you.. it's water resistant.I am so pleasantly surprised with free shipping costing under $30 on Amazon it's worth every dime. The quality is incredible for the price !I highly recommend you check it out - I've already ordered the next version Oontz 3 PLUS which is larger, plays for 30 hours and has all the same great features!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Any speaker at this size is way too small to give you REAL BASS, instead look for a speaker that is Loud. I noticed all small speakers sort of dim down the volume when the base hits & is probably becase they run on battery & there's not enough power to keep that constance bass. Save your money & get the OontZ Angle 3 Enhanced.If you must have some unreal-bass then look at all of the ones below except #1,8,9 from the list below:I purchased all of this speakers:1.

This little guy packs a big punch and is a great value for the price.  I am not a crazy audiophile here to pick apart every aspect of this unit.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this speaker for my workshop to listen to book tapes and music while working. The sound quality is very good. The Anker speaker I previously bought is also good, but I felt it had too much base and speech on it was hard to understand. The Angle 3 has a crisp sound that makes speech easy to understand. I also bought the zipper case to hold the Angle 3 and protect it from dust while not in use. Overall I would recommend this for anyone looking for a small bluetooth speaker. I have not used the speaker long enough for the battery to need recharging so I cannot comment on how long it lasts, but I have used it for over four hours with no problems.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this speaker to play music during work. We stream background music in the office, low volume. This speaker's sound is somewhat tinny with very little bass at low volume.  It sounds better as you crank it up but even then doesn't provide the richness of some other portable speakers.  I've played it both bluetooth and accessory cord and both sound equivalent.  I do love its size and ease of use. It paired with both my phone and laptop flawlessly. Volume controls are simple and functional. Charging is easy and the battery life at low volume is easily 10+ hours. And, importantly, its sized to fit in my briefcase as I travel to different offices.  Still, I was hoping for a better sound quality.  I listened to another speaker, longer but narrower, that had a much richer sound and frequency response. It also cost about twice as much as this Oontz 3.Spend a little more, get a fair bit more. Probably worth it if you listen a lot.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a compact Bluetooth speaker at a good price. It paired quickly and effortlessly with my iPhone. I use it for listening to audio books and the sound is fine. Between the iPhone volume and the speaker volume the output is loud enough for my needs. I can’t comment on music quality or whether the speaker is loud enough to fill a room or be heard above a lot of ambient noise or conversation. HOWEVER:  the product listing caption says it has a range of 100ft. I sort of knew that was too good to be true but hey, they couldn’t say it if it wasn’t true, right? Apparently they can. Not only does it not have a 100ft range, it drops the signal as soon as I leave the room where my phone is. I have $10 wireless speakers from discount stores that work on the other side of my house. If you want an  inexpensive nice sounding Bluetooth speaker and don’t need to stray far from the audio source, buy this one. If you need wireless range, pick something else.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Old review updated:  I really hate slamming a product I initially loved, but I have tried everything, and my speaker I loved so much just quit working after two months.  I have tried to post an update once before, but I must not have completed it, because no one has contacted me, and I cannot believe I am expected to keep a product I bought on Amazon as a prime member when it did not even last 6 months.  The trouble is that, even fully charged, when I turn the speaker on, it comes on for a minute, then dies.  I have done all I can do, and so now I am back to using my trusty IHome bluetooth speaker (which I bought at Radio Shack two years ago and still works like a champ.  It does not sound as good as the Oontz Speaker, but I do not have to replace it 6 times per year.  Amazon or Cambridge SoundWorks should reach out to me now.  I will keep you all posted.I have purchased several of these little Blue-tooth speakers to carry with me on picnics, place around the house for music while I am cleaning, and to carry outside for cook outs or poker night.  I bought the best one from Radio Shack for $39, and that tennis ball sized I-Home speaker was the best until Oontz.  I got the sweet red Oontz speaker a couple of weeks ago, and this evening-bag sized speaker beats all five of its predecessors in sound AND price.  My husband and I listened to some of the glorious love songs of Whitney Houston Sat night over Rhapsody connected via Bluetooth to the Oontz.  We never got up to full volume, but it sounded like that angel was singing in our den, with a choir surrounding us.  Sunday we used it to watch a movie on my tablet.  When the bad guys were surrounded I could hear the bullets whizzing past my ears. That is a STEREO.  I plan to order a couple more in a few weeks.  Once again, Amazon Prime came through with a fine product at an excellent price and two day shipping was free, as always.  Thank you, Cambridge SoundWorks for giving us Boze Quality at a price we all can pay!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why some might think it has crappy sound, and how to fix it (Not an issue with the speaker!)...The speaker has two modes... phone calls or music. If the device you are connecting to uses its ""Mic"", it will use the ""Hands Free"" Bluetooth mode. The quality of the ""Hands Free"" Bluetooth mode is sub-par. Good for phone calls, sucky for music. If the device you connect it to recognizes it as an audio device, the audio quality is WAY better, I mean night and day, but has no Mic functionality. I use it as an audio device, and I do not use its Mic functionality. If you use it with a computer, you may have to disable the hands free functionality in the Control panel > Sound (See images) to get good audio from it and to use it as a speaker. So basically it depends how the device you connect it to handles it. My Pixel 2 sees it as an audio device, and I get great quality when listening to music, then it switches over to ""Hands Free"" mode and it sounds like any other hands free Bluetooth speaker...I don't ever leave reviews hardly, but this guy is worth it. For a speaker of it's size it is GREAT. Honestly I have been extremely impressed with its performance, it really sounds rich. It has a full range sound. It is not going to have tons of bass (No small speaker does because of physical characteristics) but if you are looking for a well blended sound this guys is perfect! For its size it has a fair amount of base (As much as a small speaker can). Its mids, highs, and lows, all complement and one does not dominate the other. In addition I am 1/2 deaf, and this thing can crank. Don't get me wrong it is still a small speaker, so you aren't going to get surround sound quality, but it goes loud enough that it might even be considered uncomfortably loud (To a 1/2 deaf person).I use it as a computer speaker at night, because I can place it next to my bed so I can watch movies as I fall asleep and not bother people in the other rooms, and don't have to worry about wearing headphones.It has fairly big volume adjustments on its side, so it is easy to adjust the volume or turn the volume down in the middle of the night. I use a 4.2 pluggable USB adapter on the computer, and I am able to go into other rooms close to the computer. But it will cut out any further than that. It does sometimes struggle in rooms next to the computer, but usually you can find a spot where it works just fine.I can actually carry it into the bathroom (Very close by, only one room over) and listen to audio on my computer while I take a shower... BUT it is not going to give you any significant left/right channel, it comes out more of a mono speaker.It will cut out if you get too far away from the computer, so it def won't go through the whole house, but into a room over it should do decent. (With that USB Bluetooth 4.2 Pluggable adapter).

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second Oontz I bought (the first one being the Oontz plus, the older and bigger version). This speaker worked well initially, although I found the sound is not as crisp as the bigger version. About one month later, the plastic strip that covers the power button and USB port fell off. It made it looks kind of ugly. Aside from that, it made powering on/off the speaker very annoying because it relies you to press the plastic strip to power on/off it. Without the plastic strip, you have to use a small pin to push the little button inside a hole to turn on/off it.Worse thing, now the speaker's battery is completely dead. No matter how long you charge it through USB port, it does not have any power. Essentially, it is a dead speaker. I kind of noticed that the speaker's play time lasted shorter and shorter. But I did not really pay attention as I though I did not charge long enough. Now it is completely dead and useless.It is a very bad experience with this speaker and I would not recommend buying it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a small blue tooth speaker because the Echo Dot sound quality just wasn't cutting it and i would like to add music to whatever room I am working in that may not have a device. I have an Echo Dot 2nd and 3rd gen. The 2nd gen is tinny and the 3rd way too bass centric and boomy, but still better than this speaker. The sound quality doesn't blow me away, in fact, it is pretty bad. Not enough bass and not much of an improvement over my Echo Dot Mini 2nd Gen. Wow, this is so disappointing. The speaker paired easily with my phone and laptop, but had an issue pairing with the Alexa app via blue tooth. The controls are a pain to see in low light. As long as you keep your expectations super low you will be happy.----Update-----Lost another star after buying the Doss Touch speaker for $4 more. The Doss has MUCH better sound quality and paired to Echo Dot instantly. The Oontz seems to be having difficulties with Alexa. Probably going to return this and buy the upgraded version of the Doss 20W because I am much more impressed with that speaker as a whole. The sound quality on the Doss is more balanced and it has True Wireless Stereo so both can be used simultaneously. At first it was about being an upgrade to the Echo Dot sound quality, but now it's about better sound with every device. I was never happy with the sound on the Oontz to begin with and now it's completely unacceptable after trying a much better speaker within the same price range.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery in my ancient Bose Soundlink Mini II will no longer hold a charge so it was time to buy a really expensive new battery or just replace the speaker.  I bought the Oontz Angle 3 because of the ""rich bass"" and ""crystal clear stereo sound"" hype, the overwhelming number of excellent reviews, the small footprint and the crazy low price.The Angle 3 arrived fully charged so I plugged it into a music source (my desktop computer) and fired up some tunes.  ""Rich bass?""  Puhleez.  The sound was harsh, tinny and decidedly bass-free.  And if there was any ""crystal clear stereo"" separation going on it completely escaped me.  I actually grabbed the instructions to find out if I needed to enable something, download the latest drivers, anything...this couldn't be the same product.In retrospect I guess I wanted something for next to nothing and I got what I paid for.  This Oontz will get loud and presumably run off battery for a long time, as well as hold a BlueTooth connection over a long distance.  And the price is hard to beat.  If that's what you're shopping for this may work for you.  I don't care about any of that; I want a very compact speaker system replacement for my desktop PC that packs a punch.  This is not that item.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took this on vacation with a big group of friends and it got a ton of use.  It went to the beach with us, it was out on the deck, etc. constantly.  I used it myself, let my friends connect to it and so on.Connection - easy.  Paired it to probably 5 different phones over the course of the week and nobody had any trouble hooking up to it, and it seemed to keep a solid connection even when there was a good distance between the phone and the speaker.  There is no security code and it shows up as Oontz Angle on your phone so it is obvious what it is.  It gives a chime to tell you it has successfully paired, so it is very easy to manage.  It will automatically pair to the last device connected to it if it finds it in range when you turn it on.Battery life - if you remember to charge it at the end of the day, it does not die.  Even with heavy use, we never had it die on us during the day.Sound Quality - It can get shockingly loud without distortion for such a little speaker.  Loud enough to fill even a big room.  Probably the best way to describe the sound quality is that it is appropriate for the intended use - out at the beach, on the deck, on a picnic, etc.  This thing isn't going to replace your home stereo, or even compete with much larger speaker systems that aren't meant to be portable or go outside.  But it more than gets by.  I tend to be fairly fussy about sound quality and yet I really didn't mind listening to this little thing for hours.  Yes, you cannot really fight physics when it comes to bass, it doesn't have separate tweeters, etc. but despite all that, the sound is still somehow not objectionable.  It is not going to blow you away with how great it sounds, but given how little it costs, how small it is, and the fact that it is waterproof, it is definitely punching a few notches above its weight.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace a more expensive speaker which I use at work.  Having left the other one (JBL Flip 2) there it was eventually blown out by someone else, so I wanted to bring in something cheaper so I wouldn't care when it ends up getting ruined by inconsiderate people.The speaker is very light compared to the Flip 2.  The triangle design is much better in terms of preventing the unit from rolling off of whatever surface it's on.  It is overall not as wide as I imagined it would be.  It feels a little cheap but produces pretty good sound at a pretty good volume.  I find it a bit amusing that they would single out ""more bass"" right in the title of the item listing because that's the biggest difference I have heard so far between this and the Flip 2; the OontZ Angle does a passable job on bass heavy audio but it's nowhere near what you would get with something of higher quality like the Flip or a Bose Mini.Some of the design choices are a bit cheap feeling as well.  The indicator that the unit is charging is a slowly blinking red light.  The indicator that the unit is fully charged is that the light no longer blinks.  Good one, save the consumer a couple of dollars by just using the one LED.  You can't see this light from the front of the unit and it's not easy to see in general under 'normal' indoor lighting conditions unless you're looking right at it from a short distance.  The power button is also a source of small frustration -- I haven't figured out yet if I really need to press it two or three times to turn the unit off by design or if I'm just not pressing it hard enough or long enough.All the above negative criticism aside this is a fine product for the price.  I would say that if you've had or heard more expensive units from more established speaker brands, don't expect the sound quality of this to truly compare to them regardless of what the other reviews say.  This may be the best sound you'll get for under $30, I don't know for sure, but don't think you're cheating the system if you buy this -- if you're really into high quality spend some more money.Based on a couple of days of use in a few different situations I would buy this again.  I'd buy another one to leave up at the family cabin.  I'd consider it an easy gift purchase for a friend.  Being that it's so inexpensive I would consider it easily replaceable and not really mind if it got damaged or broken, however sad of a statement that is.Update: I DID end up buying another one of these recently to have around the house, again because it's just so good for the price.  I'm happy to say that the physical design issues I mentioned in my first review have been improved in a slight redesign.  The tactile response of the physical buttons is greatly improved.  The positioning of the status LEDs has also been improved.  I can't be positive but it feels like the sound is a little cleaner from the new unit, especially spoken word.  I'm completely happy with this now, I have nothing to nitpick.  Because of these improvements I happily updated my review from four to five stars.  You can't go wrong with this product.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Back about 2005-2010 when mini Bluetooth speakers used to be the new toy everyone wanted (and you paid the price to be an early adopter) I was really into the fad and couldn’t stop looking for the perfect one. As a result I ended up with more of them than most dealers, speakers of every possible shape and gimmick. Some of them were knock your socks off impressive, including some so small I could stuff them in my carry on when I traveled so I could have music in my hotel rooms.These days there are a handful left from the major brands. One of them I was curious about was this series from Cambridge SoundWorks, a company I’ve known and respected since I worked directly with their founder Henry Kloss back in the late 80’s and early 90’s. Unlike the early days of Bluetooth mini speakers this little speaker was only nineteen bucks, probably the lowest I’ve ever paid for any speaker. I had mixed expectations. But I chose it both for its size and its shape, I was looking for a small personal speaker to put on the base of my desktop monitor to be able to listen to content at low volume without using my high-end Boston Acoustics system.The small size is truly impressive as is the surprisingly nice look and feel of the speaker. It is heavier than similar no name speakers and you almost have to wonder how they can sell it for such a low price. It comes with a micro USB charging cable and also a mini audio cable. The power switch is easily reached near the top of the back of the speaker where the audio input and charging port are also located behind a rubber flap. The rest of the controls are on the right side of the wedge.The speaker will pair easily with newer Bluetooth devices but it seems it is not 100% compatible with all of the many standards. For example it would not pair with my desktop computer without downloading an updated Bluetooth driver.The most important thing you probably want to know is how does it sound. I’m sorry to say that with almost 20,000 review written already, many of them high energy endorsements, I’m not as impressed. I have definitely heard better from similar sized, and even smaller, speakers. It’s not bad, but it’s not knock your socks off impressive. And it’s definitely not a speaker that you would choose if there were more than one or two listeners or for use outdoors.There are a couple of things to be aware of that I liked – one is that if you use the audio cable the speaker won’t shut off automatically after a few minutes like many other brands do, but it will shut off after 15 minutes of non-playing when used in the Bluetooth mode.  Interestingly, if you pair it with an Echo device the power stays on all the time in battery mode so you would probably want to keep it plugged in to a power source if that’s your plan.I also like that you only hear the pairing sound once the first time unlike many other brands that make a loud sound whenever they are powered on or when pairing is successful. For me that is a deal breaker.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, so, every once in a while I get suckered and this is one of those times. Normally, I sort these things out and avoid the minefields of dubious products that promise big, but deliver small.Yes, this is a Bluetooth speaker, and yes, it does pair up and play music from your device, but to claim that the sound quality is anywhere near ""good"" is stretching things. There are some Bluetooth​ speakers that make you wonder just how someone managed to make so much sound come out of such a small device. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those. It sounds ""okay,"" but there is nothing about it that is going to amaze you in ANY way. Yes, it plays music, but don't expect it to amaze you in any way. It plays music like any small speaker would, but nothing more...or less, to be fair.Not sure if I'll keep this or not.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did a lot of research before choosing this speaker. I was impressed by the large number of 5 star buyer ratings. The price was excellent as well. Speaker came packaged perfectly. Included was a 3 foot Micro-USB charging cable and 3 foot 3.5mm audio cable; I wish these were longer but that is just my personal preference. Speaker came partially charged. Instructions states it can be used while charging. Speaker pairs easily and quickly, but I did experience problems getting it to disconnect from one device to pair to a different source. I contacted the company and they were quick to respond back to me. Their customer service was excellent, fast, relevant and courteous. They even offered to call me to assure that the device was working properly or not. After working with it a few days the device started working as expected and has not had an issue ever since. Maybe it was user error? Not sure. I also ordered the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS. The Angle 3 PLUS offers 30 hours of playtime vs the Angle 3 which only offers 7 hours (a big difference). The Angle 3 PLUS is a tad taller at 6 1/2"". The Angle 3 is 5 1/4"", see attached photos. I didn't notice a sound quality difference but my musician son did. He ordered the 3 PLUS and says it is a better speaker than his Jawbone Bluetooth Speaker for less than half the cost. I use the smaller speaker, which sets on a high shelf in my shower, as it is water resistant & splash proof. The other sets on my office desk. If you are considering purchasing a Bluetooth speaker definitely consider the OontZ. I would go for the Angle 3 PLUS as the price difference is only about $7 unless a smaller speaker is your goal. I have referred several people to this powerful little speaker and all are very happy with their purchase.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I almost forgot about this product as I threw it away quite a while a go.It came quickly and sounded pretty good ...  for a few months. The problem (and it shares this with many electronic devices) is the USB charging port. The USB port is flimsy. Very flimsy. Soon I had to ""jiggle"" the cord to get it to change, then no amount of finagling would get it to workPeople complain when a device has no USB but instead a 5.5mm charger/ power source ...  but at least they are bulletproof.

You certainly get what you pay for with this product. I was pleased with the sound quality when it was working, but I just can't recommend this product with less than a year life expectancy.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought this less than four months ago. The first speaker I received was defective straight out of the box. Cambridge customer service was very responsive and sent a replacement free of charge. The second speaker worked great for about three months, sounded great, appeared to be durable, very handy as hands-free phone connection in an older vehicle. Used it outside working in yard, in the shower, at my desk, without issue. Then one day it simply quit connecting via Bluetooth. I guess it works via wired connection but haven't tried. Bought it for its Bluetooth capability which is now gone. Just figured it would last longer, guess I should have listened to the negative reviews.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I never write reviews but had to since this one had so many positive reviews and I had a bad experience. I purchased on 11/27/16.  it was easy to pair with multiple devices (iPhone 6 and kindle fire), but bluetooth would not maintain connectivity from even 1 inch away on either device.  I didn't have the same issue with a braven or jambox speaker.  it kept popping and skipping over and over and finally I stopped using bluetooth and used aux cable instead.  that led to another issue.  the aux cable connection has ridiculous static.  I tried 3 diff aux cables and two diff devices and the same result: background static when playing music.  to me, this device is not reliable enough.  I probably should've returned it but it was so cheap I just dealt with it.  it is hard wired to an MP3 player to play white noise in a kids bedroom.  that's all its good for.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker is amazing!  It's a little larger and heavier than its predecessor, of which I bought 2, but that isn't a problem at all. This Angle 3 is superb!  I listen to music with my Echo, but, when in the kitchen, bedroom, etc., I use the OontZ 3 so that I don't have to have my Echo full volume and disturb my roommate!  The range is unbelievable!  I can even take it to the downstairs kitchen and it works great.  The sound that comes from this little speaker is exceptional.  It is a very full, rich sound.  While my Echo has great sound, I actually like the sound from this better.  You are also able to use the volume up/down buttons to go back or forward to the next song.  It has a pause button, also.  The charge lasts a very long time.  I bought this in June.  I use it from 2 - 6 hours a day and I have only recharged it once, but, only to keep it at full charge in case the electricity went out.  How wonderful it is to have a cordless speaker that is this great.  Makes storm power outages much more pleasant!  Power was out for 10 hours, went back out for 6 hours, and, without a charge, it worked perfectly for those 16 hours.  I absolutely love the non-skid rubber on the bottom.  Between my kitties and me, things are always getting knocked around. This speaker doesn't move!  It doesn't even slide easy!  In the kitchen, the OontZ 3 got splashed quite a bit.  The water stayed on the covering and wiped off easy.  Fixing to buy a second one for my roommate!  I LOVE IT!!!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this for my parents (older) so they can play music/YouTube videos from their iPad. I showed them how to use it (very simple to operate) and it will work perfectly for them in that sense. The size and the sound quality is good to.My biggest problem with this Bluetooth speaker is that it’s pure solid black (including all the buttons). The black buttons are very difficult to see because they blend in with the color of the device. You can’t see them unless you hold this device at a particular angle and under a bright light. What genius at the manufacture thought of this design? Stupid design. A younger person must have thought of it.The manufacturer could have easily made the buttons a different color (other than black) so that they can be seen easily. I had to put drops of white paint on top of the buttons so they can easily be seen now. I shouldn’t need to have done that. The manufacture should have designed it that way! How hard would that have been. Pathetic.If you are older, do not buy this. Choose another brand and just know that most of these tech companies these days design things for younger people and don’t give a crap about older people’s needs. Good luck.

I am grateful for their outstanding customer service and gladly changed this review to 5 stars.- - - - - - - - - -Let's get this out of the way right from the start. The reason for the one star review is because eight days after the return period expired (38 days after purchase) the speaker will no longer charge. The mini-usb connector on the unit is of poor quality and deformed easily rendering the speaker useless. See picture.When it worked, it was fantastic and I bought a second one for my girlfriend. The sound is great for a unit this size and the bass is remarkable. It even jumped off a table a few times because the bass was making the whole thing bounce. In summary, I was thrilled with this purchase up to the minute it bricked itself. I'm not crazy about the 30 day return window when the merchandise is defective. 😡

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My trusty little CA speaker (non Bluetooth) had just died after 11 years of faithful service, so I was on the hunt for a replacement.  I searched Amazon extensively and decided on the OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen) because of the price and reviews.  Had I continued searching within the OontZ line of products, I would have purchased the slightly more expensive (and a bit larger) model with the ability to switch tracks from the speaker and the extended battery life.  But, I bought the OontZ Angle 3.  My first impression when it arrived was that it was way smaller than expected, but that's a good thing.  I use the unit with a 3mm headphone jack cable attached to my iPod, so I'm already way lower tech than the folks who will use this as a Bluetooth speaker.  I use this speaker on my motorcycle rides - not on the bike itself, but in the tent or motel when I land.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The bass could be a little deeper, but overall it sounds great and gets loud.  My minor complaint(s) with the unit are as follows:  1) it's all black  (by the way this comes in several colors, which I didn't realize when I ordered)  Because it's all black, the controls are hard to see  2) the little rubbery flap that lifts up (near the on/off button)  which contains the charging port and headphone jack - looks like it will tear off if not handled VERY carefully.  I play mine standing on end in order to get the most bass quality, otherwise the bass speaker is facing downward and the sound is somewhat muffled.  If I had it to do over, I would buy the larger OontZ Angle and buy it in a color other than black.  Otherwise, I love the speaker.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Charging this thing is annoying. The light stays red the entire time you're charging and it gives no indication that it is done charging. I can leave it on the charger for a full day and the light will just stay pulsing red. So I never know when it is actually done charging, or how long it actually takes to fully charge because there is not indicator.Battery life is pretty poor for a bluetooth speaker. This thing is a little over a year old and it gets around 8 hours of play before the battery dies.. It also doesn't give a warning that the battery is getting low, it just dies. By comparison, my cheap $20 anker BT headphones get nearly the same battery life. Also, my old Photive Hyrda speaker that I had for 3 years maintained it's battery life very well and would consistently get 18 hours of battery life even though it was rated to only get up to 8 hours.Maybe mine is a dud, because of all the good reviews. But the battery is definitely very poor. Also, I play music with the volume at around 50-70% so the battery life should be at least as good, or even better than they advertise. (Since they rate their battery life using the device at 2/3 volume (66%))As far as the waterproofing, it's very good. I use it in the shower all the time and have taken it kayaking and to the beach. Never had an issue with that. The sound is very good for it's size too.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker is better than what our 48 inch TV can put out. I read the reviews and saw how many people were happy with it but I wasn't expecting it to be so crisp. The volume goes louder than I would ever play it in my home but I can see this being amazing in a crowded loud room. Let alone a shower.The bass is perfect, it's just a really good little speaker. I have a feeling well be getting a lot of use out of it. We've had other speakers before but they end up collecting dust because they were cheap and the sound quality was the same as a smart phone. I mean, the cheap ones aren't even comparable to this.Bluetooth connecting was seamless. For instance, I have a Bluetooth receiver in my car even after years of using it it takes 30 seconds to pair even with a remembered device. My husband pressed the pair button on his phone and it instantly paired. Although, if you do have some trouble pairing, you can always use the auxiliary cord included.This says it takes 5-6 hours to fully charge and the charge can last up to 12 hours at 2/3 of the volume. It also says you can use it while it charges.This was really good money spent. I don't think I've ever been more impressed with something for the price. If you had shown me this and I didn't know the price I would say it's worth 50$ which I wouldn't spend on a speaker. I'm so happy with this I'm gonna be buying more as gifts for Christmas for sure.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Oontz Angle 3 is the best selling bluetooth speaker on Amazon and after trying others in the same price range, one can can see why. The sound is loud, clear and well balanced requiring no eq. On some songs the treble can be a bit forward sounding but for the most part it is stable. The bass is passable but nothing special. The sound quality of the Angle 3 is better than most of the competitors I have tried in this price range.Out-of-the-box the Angle 3 came with 30% charge enabling me to test it immediately. Battery life is reasonable, shows up in iOS and is in check with the specifications printed on manufacturer’s website.The Angle sports a triangular design with two drivers on the front configured in stereo and a passive radiator located at the bottom allowing the Angle 3 to resonate bass frequencies off the surface its placed on.The Angle 3 has two rubber pads on the bottom near both ends. I listen mostly to rock however if you play a track with excessive bass like “Billie Eilish - you should see me with a crown” at max volume the Angle 3 will move about on the table. This could have been prevented if SoundWorks installed weight strips in the Angle 3. This isn’t an issue for most music played through these but it’s still something to consider.Pairing the Angle 3 to my iPhone was simple and the connection is solid, even at great distances. The Angle 3 features a play/pause, volume controls. The volume controls are independent of iOS so you will have to set both at applicable levels.Films are a joy to watch on-the-go with the Angle 3 as audio plays back in sync with video. There is barely any noticeable latency when paired with my iPhone. Very important.Color: I love white electronics and would have appreciated SoundWorks providing the option of purchasing the Angle 3 in solid white as opposed to the black/white combination. As the option wasn’t available, I purchased the solid black version.The Angle 3 is a great little bluetooth speaker. It deliverers clear and balanced audio at an in-expensive price point. It could benefit from more bass, however considering the construction, competition and price point this is not a bad buy.

I don't know if it's my fault, since it is recessed, and shouldn't need any special things to plug it in (I've had other micro-USB connectors that are still working well after 5 years), but I can't charge it any more.Because I like the size and the sound when it did work, I did purchase another one.

I found it sounding ""tinny"", not much in the base department. It is loud but can get then distortion. Otherwise, It was easy to set up and works properly. Since returning it at this price point is a bother, I will keep it and find some use for it, but I will likely buy a better one. Added Note 5/31/18: article in Washington Post some weeks ago suggests bluetooth speakers have been a significant target of fraudulent reviews which I think explains clearly why the reviews are grossly inflated.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The alternator recently died in my Saturn Vue and took the factory standard stereo with it (which was already a bit wonky). I tried changing the fuses and my mechanic made sure it wasn't something he unintentionally caused and could correct when he was taking care of the alternator, all to no avail. And after the alternator, an A/C repair a couple of months ago, and work done on the fuel system a couple of months prior to that I'm not exactly in a place to replace the stereo, so I've been trying to get by the last couple of weeks with just my headset or one of the other Bluetooth speakers we have, including our beloved VicTsing. Unfortunately, the volume just could not compete with road noise intrusion and the bass was blown out and static-y.  That and I prefer to have my caterwauling masked by loud music and bass, so it's been a sad couple of weeks of commuting unless I stuck to podcasts and even then I couldn't really hear lower register sounds over the road noise.This little gem arrived yesterday and I was immediately blown away by just how loud it could get in a 10x15 room, let alone a vehicle cabin! The sound is clear and the bass is deep and not distorted, even at top volume. It has super grippy little feet on the bottom that kept it solidly on my dashboard for my entire commute, even going around corners and making turns! And while it's not exactly the same as having the surround of multiple speakers, front and back, it totally works as I need it to.  The sound fills the cabin and for the most part, it's akin to having my stereo back in working order. Thank you to Oontz for providing an inexpensive solution!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker was purchased over others because there was an Amazon recommendation next to it.  It just does not really sound good.  I have tried it in multiple settings, such as in the car, on office desk, hooked up to Amazon Dot in the kitchen.  It is OK for music and terrible for spoken word.  For music it boosts the sound volume of my other devices and adds base.  The trouble is the mid range of the speaker.  If you listen to any talk radio or books, do not buy this speaker.  It makes the voice of the speaker sound like he is singing/speaking on the chipmunks album.  I have never heard anything like it.  I tried downloading some equalizer apps, but that did not work either.  It is actually very bad to listen to this speaker and now I guess I will have to gift it to someone or just let it sit collecting dust, because I cannot stand to listen to it.  I am now also jaded to Amazon's choice or Amazon's pick or whatever they call it.  It is obviously just a brazen sales ploy instead of an actual recommendation like consumer reports or other rating sites.  I suspect from my experience with this speaker that they just recommended it to get rid of the stock.  I waffled between two stars 'I don't like it' and one star 'I hate it'.  I hate it.  One star. I have to make an addendum to this review. Since I was not able to figure out how to return this item, I have used it subsequently in a very limited fashion. The chipmunk sound that I described has not recurred, so I suspect and Internet or provider error. The sound quality is not great, but this is a very small speaker.  I am not thrilled with the sound but I’m also not extremely unhappy with the device as I was previously. Rating has been changed from one star to three stars

Packaging is a nonissue) I immediately blasted the volume and threw on some tunes. I was disappointed with the speaker even with the crazy low price (mid $20s). It was tinny. I dont have a bunch of fancy audiophile terminology to throw your way to convince you I know what I'm talking about, but I do listen to music for most of my waking hours and I know what sounds good and what frankly sounds like crap. It sounded like crap,Ive used it quite a bit since then and am much happier with the purchase. At low to mid volumes this thing really shines. It is still a cheap, portable bluetooth speaker; you can't even compare the sound to a decent stereo system. For what it is, though, it is a great little speaker. It is much smaller than I expected, is loud, is light, and seems to be living up to the waterproof claims, although I have not submerged it fully.I was disappointed to find that there is no way to attach a caribeener to this, as far as I can tell.I am happy with my choice and purchase.If you are looking for a similarly priced speaker to use in a dry, stable environment I like the DOSS Soundbox's sound a bit more.Neither of those will really compare to a decent sound system, of course, but for $20-$40 you can't expect much.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought three Bluetooth speakers hoping ONE would be usable.  All three ended up being keepers for different reasons. I bought the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3, the Anker Classic Portable, and the Boombotix REX.Portability:  All three are fantastic, no real difference.  If you want to nitpick, the Boombotix is the smallest, the Anker is next, and the Cambridge is the largest.  But again, none of them are really different.  I give an edge to the Boombotix for it's clip, it's more flexible. The clip is super hard to get open though. You aren't clipping it to anything thick.Construction and Ergonomics: All three seem durable and well built.  The Anker is clearly the best of the three. It's classy, attractive, and feels substantial.  And it doesn't walk itself around too much with vibration.  But the On/Off switch is terrible.  It's tiny and hard to use, you have to use your fingernail.  The other buttons are functional, but not as easy to use as the other two. The Boombotix is sturdy and easy to use, the buttons are a little close together, but they work well. It's walks around a little on a hard table, but not terribly. You will have to watch it though, or it will eventually fall off a table.  The Cambridge Angle 3 is sturdy and I love the shape. It works really well being able to either lay it down or stand it up. The function buttons are easy to use.  The On/Off button is not great, it's too small and in an obscure location. So much so that they have to put a little sticker pointing to it.  The rubber end caps are a mixed blessing.  I think they will help protect it, but they get really dirty really fast.  They pick up every tiny little bit of dust.  I recommend standing it up if you put a lot of volume through it because once the bass starts to thump it will bounce and wiggle it's way all over the place.  It's actually kinda funny looking.  But standing up the passive radiator on the bottom doesn't propel it all over.Sound: I was actually impressed with all three. None of them are on par with the large Sound Dock or Klipsch type speakers, but they could hardly be expected to compete with those at this size and price.The Cambridge is my favorite because it has more bass than the other two.  It's a clear winner in bass response. probably about 10-15% more. And that's important to me. The Anker actually has the best overall sound.  It's rich and clean. It's probably the ""best"" speaker of all three.  And the Boombotix is clearly the loudest.  It really puts out some sound.  none of them sound bad at all.  I would have been happy with any of the three if I hadn't heard the others.  But hearing them side by side the Angle 3 fits what I need best.Connectivity: None were bad, but the Boombotix lost connection first, the Angle 3 and the Anker had no trouble at all at 30ft even through walls (but none liked going through a stone fireplace LOL).  None were an issue connecting.  They were all easy as pie to pair.  The Anker was slowest when powering on and trying to find my phone, but we're talking about less than 10 seconds total time for the slowest.Intangibles: The Boombotix has some features that are really appealing. There's an audio out jack, which you can use to run a second speaker (of any make).  So that give you options. Send Bluetooth to the speaker and then it will send it to a second speaker. If you don't have a Bluetooth connection on one of your larger speakers you can send signal to the REX and it will connect to your larger speaker.  Options are nice.I chose the Angle 3, it fits my needs best with the best imitation of bass, but the others are good enough that I've decided to keep them and use them too.  The Anker is nicest, and the Boombotix is loudest and most versatile.  I can't really speak to longevity since I haven't had them very long, but I don't think any of them will die on me. Don't be afraid to buy any of these. Just pick the one that fits best.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like any product, this speaker has both good and less than good points.  Having just received it, I am limited to immediate experience, although thus far more good than bad:Oontz Angle 3 Speaker (Geez, what a name!) appears well constructed, with good, solid feeling to it; although it isn't at all heavy.  It doesn't have any apparition nor feeling of being loosely constructed, with good and tight fitting rubber seals and grommet for power/hard cable connection port.  It was a bit difficult to get grommet open for charge the first time, but using some blunt tool removes it easy enough...Make sure you don't use anything like a sharp knife or like edged tool, because the rubber grommet could be accidentally cut easily enough when trying to lift it out initially. That's not a point for complaint, because speaker is supposed to be water proof enough to take in the shower, although user pamphlet expressively warns against full submersion.  I as well like the fact the pamphlet is well written, easy to understand in explaining functions and set up, and I am thrilled by the fact it is completely in English; as opposed to multi language documents that are written in several languages at microdot font. It's definitely a high point for me to see the instructions are completely in English, but higher still, designed and engineered in America! It is manufactured in China however (What isn't these days?), and I would have preferred American manufacturing and paid more for it if it was.Bluetooth pairing with my iPhone 7 Plus was simple and easy, and activated the pairing mode was very easy, requiring only the user depress and hold the Bluetooth button, which is lit when in use, for a few seconds until it reacts by fast flash.  After that, it's just a matter of selecting it in iPhone settings menu, and it will continue to ""look"" for the speaker after powering on and off, or turning it on for other sessions.  Although it hasn't yet been a problem for me with Oontz speaker, it is sometimes important to reselect chosen device in iPhone if you want another device selection (such as Plantronics headset or other device); although that's iPhone's issue and not Oontz Angle 3 Speaker's.So how does it sound? (Thought you'd never ask!):  It's a fairly good, responsive speaker with good resonating effects, deep base response, and good mid and high end response.  Bear in mind this is a small, portable speaker running off an internal battery, so if you're wanting several hundred watts to rival Bose speakers, this ain't it! But it's no slouch of a portable speaker either, and it would be absolutely perfect for bedside, hotel, bathroom-shower morning music and like use.  It would be perfect for kids' rooms, although no kid is truly happy unless he can annoy parents with high volume, preferably including the neighbors while at it, and this little speaker just isn't made for window-shattering output.It gets a little tricky if your playlists are ""eclectic from hell"" like mine are! Neal Young and Rolling Stones comes out great using iPhone's ""Small Speakers"" EQ setting, Temptations does better using ""R&B"" or ""Pop,"" and I have yet to isolate best for Grateful Dead...But ""Rock"" comes near (but not quite there) the mark. Junior Walker imposes a problem I have yet to solve...And who can live without?  All in, you'll likely find a good setting for one album or genre of music, but you would do well to expect to use more than one if you really like your music like I do. Still, that no buzz killer by me. I like it just as much! Again, if you want to share your music with residents two flights up or around the block, this won't be your answer, but I have a 700 watt Yamaha receiver to accomplish that need anyway.Oontz Angle 3 speaker comes partially charged enough to pair and try right out of the box, although I soon connected it to supplied cable and to a USB charger I already had.  Instructions say it can take ""5-6 hours to fully charge a low battery,"" but how ""low"" it is on delivery is anyone's guess.  Good news is you can listen while charging it, and it's recommended to fully charge initially. I note user pamphlet states higher volume level will affect play time, but it says you'll get ""up to 12 hours at 2/3 volume.""Hands Free function for telephone user however, does present a weak point.  Sound of incoming party is reasonably good and nothing to complain about, but the microphone on the Oontz Angle 3 does indeed leave much to be desired! I tried it in a reasonably quiet surrounding without background noise, a little less than two feet away in normal voice that I would use with other hands free telephone devices, using my own voicemail message to gauge sound quality. The result was very tinny, with a very distant reception that gives perception of being very far from the microphone when you're not.  Since I don't expect to ever much rely on that function anyway, at most to grab a very important call while in the shower or like setting, that's no deal breaker to me.  If you expect to make a lot of hands free telephone use however, you should be aware of that and immediately test it to see if it's something you can rely on. The upside is it automatically went into telephone mode and enabled the microphone without having to switch, and it immediately returned to playing music once call was terminated. Since cell phone issues can be sourced to any number of reasons (connection, device location, etc,), it isn't always evident for where the problem cause is...So test that soon, once you get it!All in, end of the day, and bottom line:  This is a great deal!  I believe I am getting more than what I would expect for $25 Bluetooth-connected, small portable speaker, and it sounds really good in the entire room, and isn't limited to being sweet-spot in front of it. The base comes most from the bottom of speaker and has easily discernible mid and high range outputs, which is hard to find on small speakers at all, let alone portable AND Bluetooth. It will easily be benefited in smaller space with tiled walls like most bathrooms tend to be, and neither it nor the manufacturers fear a hot shower, provided you don't ask it to scrub your back. It would work very well in a kitchen, bedside or hotel room without causing the front desk to ask you for an much earlier check out...Like now or sooner.  It has it's limitations like anything else, but for reasonable volumes and user expectations, it's still a score!  There's only one thing I would want that wasn't part of the buying experience: Free shipping from Amazon (Hint, hint!!).  I would buy another and I do recommend it! Thumbs up, stars, and a few backflips...And nobody is giving me anything for this review.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker is very poor quality. I've used it for several months now and get more frustrated every time. I listen to it for about 30-45 minutes at a time. Sometime is works great and sometimes I want to throw it out the window. The issue is with the Bluetooth. Most days, the speaker has little hiccups where it looses Bluetooth connection, pauses the music, and then reconnects. I then have to press play again on my phone. This regularly happens 2-3 times PER song! Incredibly frustrating. I tried using an aux cable to get around the Bluetooth issue, but using an aux cable lowers the overall volume of the speaker significantly. Do not buy!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not suggest getting these speakers at all.  The first one I got stopped working within the  first couple months, I had gotten the extended warranty and was sent a replacement,  that one stopped working as well within a couple months.  They sent yet another replacement even though I mentioned my concern that the speakers weren't working after a few months.  The replacement again lasted a few months and stopped.  I wrote the company again and they are saying sorry you're no longer under warranty not our problem.  I will never buy speakers from this company again and suggest others not to, especially when they keep breaking down so quickly and the company says basically yeah we aren't standing behind our product.  Look elsewhere for speakers and know even with extended warranty they won't back up products not even a year old.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product!! I purchased this for a cross country road trip in an '80s Camaro with a busted radio. It worked great for my cross country trip; I could hear it over road noise and the battery life was sufficient for an 8 hour day.  (The cigarette lighter was also busted so it was important for the battery to last as long as possible.)  The sound quality is also excellent!  It really thumps when you crank it up.  I love this little speaker!  I use it all the time at home, its so portable and again I stress the great battery life.  It goes for quite a while between charges.  I had no problems pairing it with my Samsung Galaxy S6.  I also like the rubber feet it has which made it stay right on the dash where I placed it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I cross shopped the Oontz Angle 3 and Amazon Basics speaker (the cheaper 2.5-watt speaker from Amazon, NOT the 3W amazonbasics speaker). I was surprised to see no reviews comparing the two since they are a similar price so this experience may help others like myself.I use this with a fire tablet HD8 which we keep in Show mode in the kitchen (the stock speakers on the tablet are terrible).SOUND QUALITY: The sound quality between these two is very close. If you are not picky you may not notice a difference at lower volumes.  However the Oontz Angle 3 has better clarity particularly when the volume is turned up. I would place the sound quality similar to the larger Amazon Echo cylinder (I have the 1st gen Echo). However these both will get louder than the Echo so they may sound better if you like loud music (see volume below).BASS: Don't expect this to shake the house like your aftermarket car stereo system. There is just a slight thump and nothing that will cause vibrations. But enough that you know bass belongs in that part of the song. That thump is more subdued in the AmazonBasics speaker but only slightly.VOLUME: Both of these get quite loud. We never have this at full volume, usually keep the Oontz at about 60-70% volume at most, and this is loud enough that we are basically yelling over the speaker to talk in the kitchen.CONNECTIVITY and BATTERY: I combined these topics because both are excellent, connecting either the AmazonBasics or Oontz was a breeze. Neither breaks connection and both batteries have yet to die after weeks of staying on. Oontz includes a 3.5mm stereo aux cable and Amazon does not. This may be a deal breaker for some of you. Note that BOTH have the jack on the device, but only the Oontz gives the wire.One caveat: The Oontz will power down if it is not plugged in. Supposedly this is not the case if it is connected to an Echo. However when connected to my Fire HD8 tablet in Show mode, it does still power down. To work around this I have to keep the Oontz plugged in so it won't shut down. This is not the case with AmazonBasics 2.5W speaker connected to my HD8.BUILD QUALITY: I was impressed with both of these speakers build quality. The Oontz has a more rubber feel whereas AmazonBasics is plastic. Buttons are easier to press on the Amazonbasics speaker and also easier to see. The reason being that the Oontz is black rubber with black volume symbols so you really need to look at it to find the button. But that is a minor gripe. When used with an Alexa device, you'll probably adjust volume by voice.I think the Rubber would do better with drops or being thrown in a bag, but I did not actually test this. With that said if you plan to keep the speaker in one place I don't think either of these will fall apart easily.OTHER: The Oontz can be placed vertically or horizontally. The AmazonBasics speaker can only be placed horizontally. If your space is tight, Oontz may win out here.One last thing: THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WITH THE SPEAKER ITSELF. However, this applies if you are planning to use this like I am. This speaker is connected to my HD8 via bluetooth. When music is playing, the tablet has such a poor mic that it cannot pick up the ""Alexa"" command unless I pause the music. When no music is playing the mic seems to pick up just fine. This has bothered me to the point I may just put my regular first gen Echo back in the kitchen. It's frustrating to play music and not be able to stop it with your voice (yes I know, first world problems).CONCLUSION: Both are quality products, Oontz just barely edges out the AmazonBasics speaker in clarity and bass but only at higher volumes. Also Oontz includes a 3.5mm wire whereas AmazonBasics speaker does not. Both will greatly augment sound quality of an Amazon Fire tablet or Echo Dot. Quality is similar to the cylinder Amazon Echo but louder.Edited for clarification.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this speaker for several months, and it is fantastic. It's very small, with a similar footprint as a cellphone, and the build quality is shockingly good, with a metal grill, high quality plastics, and nice silicone end pieces.It has excellent sound with surprisingly good bass. I have started using it as a practice amp for my electric bass and it sounds good, though it does distort if I play loudly on the lowest string. It would work perfectly as a small guitar amp. The big surprise is the sheer volume, though - it has annoy your neighbor kind of volume in a tiny package. It is very slightly quieter than a good set of desktop speakers on maximum volume, enough to hurt if you're sitting right next to it.The battery life is great, and it doesn't lose much over time either, it still had a 90% charge after two months on a shelf. It connects instantly and reliably to my gen 1 pixel and mobile playback controls work perfectly. (volume up/down, play/pause, and forward/back)From some other reviews it seems like there may be some minor quality control issues, but Amazon has a fantastic return policy, so don't worry about it. I haven't had any problems with it at all.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this portable speaker to play music when we go to the beach, an upcoming rafting trip, upcoming camping trip etc. I was immediately surprised by the size of this speaker - it's much smaller than I thought it would be - which is great in my books as that adds to portability. Secondly, I played a song on it (Despacito) and Luis Fonsi absolutely killed it on these speakers! It was LOUD and clear. Bass was beautiful too. Pairing with my iPhone literally took seconds.Now with my camping and rafting trips a few weeks out, I placed this speaker in my home office while still paired with my phone. I got an incoming call and it unintentionally went to this speaker. Call quality and volume = beautiful. But what really surprised me was that the built in mic works great too! If any of you work from home and take phone calls/conference calls - this little speaker will quickly become your best bud. I have a landline that i use to make phone calls primarily because of the speakerphone - i no longer need that as using this speaker in conjunction with my phone is the ultimate combo.Love love it. Highly recommend.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this speaker for about a year and a half, and in the beginning, it worked perfectly.  However, about 6 months ago, I noticed the Bluetooth stopped working, and it won't wirelessly pair with my ipod anymore.  But it's possible that's more the fault of my ipod (it's kind of old), and I can still use the AUX plug, so no harm no foul, I guess.  However, even when I pair it with my iphone, it sometimes doesn't work or requires me to fiddle with it in order to get to work.  Also, I had the speaker playing yesterday after having charged it overnight, and it kept cutting off for some reason.  Maybe it didn't charge sufficiently (I'm not sure why that would be the case), so I will try again today to use it, and hopefully the problem doesn't repeat itself.  Overall, I have enjoyed having it, the sound quality is pretty good (at least in my opinion), and I would buy it again even knowing that it might only work perfectly for about a year or so.Update: Speaker no longer holds a charge no matter how long you plug it in for. I was hoping this would last me longer than it actually did. Going to try a different brand next time.2nd Update: I contacted the company and they sent me a second speaker, free of charge.  It works perfectly.  Customer service for this company is really on point and is greatly appreciated.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"All the 5 star reviews on this speaker claiming that it has great sound quality are pretty deceiving for those looking for decent sound. This is a pretty poor speaker. At low volume it sounds hollow with no fullness to the sound. It's not much better at higher volumes as the treble is harsh and the mids start to blend together. It's very fatiguing to listen to for extended periods.It connects easily and I never had any pairing problems so that at least works well. This would be something that I might take on a camping trip and not worry about destroying. I would suggest doing some research and spending more on a better speaker. You will thank yourself in the end. I own several bluetooth speakers now that I spent quite a bit more on, but they were worth the extra money. However, if you just want something cheap to take on a trip and you don't care if it gets lost or stolen, then this might work out.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"DKnight ($28.99) vs  OontZ Angle 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker ($24.99).(I also tested the Kunodi Outdoor Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker,Wireless Portable Mini Shower Travel Speaker with Subwoofer$14.99. Not even in the same league).I A-B these two models, same songs, same settings, even used a db meter to make it legit, apples to apples kind of comparison.The DKnight has a warmer overall sound, great bass and decent mids and highs, unfortunately it seems like its been discontinued, I was going to order 3 more (I already have 3 of them for the fam), you can still find them on ebay but they jack you on the shipping. Now the OontZ was a real surprise, great Bass, has a lot more headroom as far as volume, it can get up to 90db +- (both can), very similar to the output on the DK .Though they're both rated at 10W I felt the OontZ was certainly louder. It might be a little on the bright side, and I dont mean that in a bad way, the Mids & HF really shined through, more so than the DKnight. On your cell or Ipod you can taylor the sound via equalizer so its not a game changer in any way. Both are really fantastic little Bluetooth speakers and anyone searching for  a good quality sound at a great price would be quite pleased with either one of them. I hope DKnight will continue the line but as is all too common it might be the end of the line at least for this model. Thankfully the OontZ is a winner and the cheaper price is a win win IMO.Get the While YOu Can!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical about this speaker at first but overall I'm pretty happy with it. It gets a lot louder than I expected and was even loud enough for my small wedding reception. The sound quality is fantastic as well. I only have 2 complaints about it.1. It takes an eternity to fully charge, and then the battery drains way faster than I'd like it to (about 3 hours of constant use).2. The Bluetooth distance is very limited. You basically have to keep your phone or music device right next to it or the music starts cutting out and sounding like a skipping CD.So if you want to use it unplugged, make sure you're charge it for a full day before you use it. And keep your audio device within ten feet or so if you want to avoid your music cutting out.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great little sound box. I've had mine for a little over a year now and I've used it for multiple functions. I initially bought it to use at a park for a memorial bbq since the city wanted a much larger deposit for ""amplified"" sound. Since a speaker doesn't count as amplified sound, I decided go that route. This little guy didn't disappoint and the sound carried well over 50 feet in either direction at half volume without sounding like it was coming out of a coffee can.I wouldn't say it's as great as the higher end sound systems you can buy with a seperate sub woofer, but it works very well for me and it is durable. It has been cranked up pretty loud without damage to the speaker. The Bluetooth connectivity is very quick and simple unless the battery is low. I've had this thing going for about 5 hours and never had to charge it. I've taken it camping and I use it on my patio pretty much every weekend. At low volume it sounds good, at high volume it sounds good. Although, I've found that depending on the surface it sits on, it can sound a little different. So I wouldn't recommend sitting it on hollow metal.It's very durable made and I've left it out in the sun and the rain without any issues or signs of sun damage. For the price, this is a very good buy. I didn't get it for free or anything so these are my genuine unbiased opinions.I think I only spent about 30 bucks on it. So I would highly recommend.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a FedEx driver, and wanted a bluetooth speaker that would let me listen to music and especially audiobooks as I drove around. I purchased the first generation OontZ speaker OontZ Angle Bluetooth Speaker [ORIGIINAL] Ultra Portable Wireless with Built in Mic up to 10 Hour Playtime works with iPhone iPad tablet Samsung and smart phones - Black Grille, and it served my purposes fairly well. It wasn't loud enough for our larger package trucks, but for the smaller ones, it worked fairly well. It was a bit of a strain to hear it, though, at highway speeds.I had a charging issue with the speaker after I had been using it for 8 months; I charged it all night, and the next day, it would run for a little while and go dead. I contacted Cambridge, and a helpful rep named Jennifer cheerfully offered to ship me the new OontZ Angle 3 as a free replacement for my older generation model that was acting up. It arrived two days later, and I've been loving it ever since. Even apart from their willingness to replace my product, the customer service is outstanding.Pros: It is louder. I had mentioned that the previous generation was difficult to hear at highway speeds; not the Angle 3. (FedEx Express drivers, note: this speaker will overcome the engine noise for the old Sprinters, the newer Benzes, and of course, the Nissans and the ancient Ford panel vans. The larger W700 and W900 vehicles are still just too loud for this sort of speaker, IMO).I love the play/pause button on the end of the speaker, which allows me to pause an audiobook without messing with my phone. The manual says that this button doesn't work with all apps, but it does work with the Audible app I use.The styling of the Angle 3 is superior to the earlier generation. The stick-on rubber knobs on the bottom of the earlier generation have been replaced by two inch-and-a-half-long rubber strips set into recesses on the bottom of the speaker. I have both in front of me; a gentle push will move the old generation speaker across the table with some resistance, but the Angle 3 is much more resistant to moving. One of the rubber knobs had come off the old model, and I had to stick it back on; I don't see how that sort of thing would even be possible with the Angle 3. As well, there is a rubber-like covering on both ends, and this makes the speaker less angular and ""sharp"".As with the old speaker, the battery life is truly outstanding. I have been surprised at how long a single charge will last.I'm no expert, but I find the clarity of the sound excellent. It certainly serves my purposes for listening to audiobooks.My single ""con"" for the speaker is that it shuts down (to conserve battery) after fifteen minutes of non-use, if it is not plugged in. Not that it's difficult to turn back on! But I'd prefer an option that lets it remain on indefinitely. But that is a minor detail, and doesn't keep me from rating this a 5-star product.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this speaker because I was looking for a relatively inexpensive speaker that I can use in the shower. I was looking at a few speakers but eventually decided on the OobtZ because of its features, price and sheer amount of positive feedback. In this review I will focus on the pros and cons that make this speaker a good choice for a speaker under $30.Starting off the shipping was fast as expected. I opened the box and got a fairly simple unvoxing with a charger, manual and 3.5 chord which I was very happy about because many speakers don't come with one. It came with a mostly full battery which was nice.  Initial thoughts on sound were as follows: It has a decent bass for the price and has mids and highs that were clear but a bit crunchy (especially at high volumes). It gets loud enough for a small rom and most certainly a shower or bathroom. Aesthetically it is very slick with a metal grill and rubber endcaps. The size also lends to excellent portability. The controls are easy to use and pairing was very simple. So to sum it all up I will list my personal pros and cons when using the speaker.ProsWater resistance for shower and water useGood portable sizeGood overall soundEasy controls and pairingConsLacks deep bass but this is to be expected with a speaker of this priceCrunchy highs but not so bad that it is hard to listen toNot fully waterproof so don't fully submerge itSo in conclusion this is a very well rounded speaker that is good in all categories but not necessarily amazing in sound which is expected for a $30 speaker. I would say this speaker is great for a shower speaker or something you throw in the bag to a pool, beach or for just casual listening if you don't need top notch sound.

There is now a noticeable difference in the quality of audio. Aditionally, the battery is maintaining far fewer hours of charge. That is of course, when it charges. Which, I'm sure, is do to the fact that the case melted and is now warped. Did I mention that the case melted and warped? That all being said, if you intend to use this in your car or next to a fire while camping (or a heat source and etc.), do not. In fact, if you aren't in the frigid indoors just save yourself the trouble and don't use it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this speaker.  I've had it for about three months and have used it several times before writing this.  I love music and really want a quality Bluetooth speaker with a well-rounded sound.  This OontZ delivers.  It has a great sound with a nice low end.  Of course, it doesn't have a deep end like a separate subwoofer, but you can hear the bass notes really well.  I play bass guitar and want to hear the low end.  This speaker delivers really well.  The controls are easy to use and I have had no problems connecting to my iPhone or iPad.  The battery life is great as well.  It will last all day long.This speaker really shines when it is set on a flat, solid surface as the bass comes from the bottom.  It loses the low end if it is carried in your hand or just tossed on a bed or placed outside on the grass.  If it is placed on any solid surface the speaker produces a fantastic tone.  I own a DOSS Touch Bluetooth speaker and a Bose Soundlink Bluetooth speaker.  The Oontz outperforms the DOSS hands down based off of controls, sound (when placed on a flat surface) and simplicity of use.  The DOSS does sound great and is not dependent on placement nearly as much as the Oontz, but I prefer the Oontz.  The Bose does sound better than this Oontz with similar controls but not by much.  And the price of the Oontz is much better.  If money were no problem and sound quality was the top priority, I would pick the Bose over this speaker.  But considering you could purchase at least four of these Oontz speakers for the price of one Bose, the Oontz wins hands down. It sounds great, has a long battery life, connects easily and does NOT have an annoying series of beeps like the DOSS when connecting to your phone.

Have they broken up? seriously, I've tried everything, all the trouble shooting tips and nothing works, just endless blinking blue light and Alexa giving up finally. Bummed, cuz I was lovin on this little speaker....****UPDATE****Cambridge Soundworks called me to help reset the thing after a recent Amazon dot update...Go into your settings on the alexa app, delete the app, unplug the Dot, wait.......power back up, go into app settings, find new device, and re-connect. Simple as can be. I love this thing so much!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't really tell you how well this product functions because, unlike the new product I thought I ordered, I was sent a ""speaker"" that was apparently well used. It had accumulated the kind of gunk in the speaker grill that takes at least months if not years to collect, as well as a tremendous amount of scratches around the charging port. Someone connected this and disconnected this quite a few times. Worst of all, it can't be charged.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the older OontZ Ultra-Portable Wireless speaker. This unit is a replacement. It's a great speaker, with many of the Oontz features, but updated for better performance. The sound quality is better than my previous Oontz with more bass and richer highs and midrange. I use this as a bedroom speaker for relaxation and sleeping sound tracks like ocean and forest sounds. The volume is great and has plenty of range and power for the room. The sound quality doesn't suffer at higher volumes. I listen to ambient sounds as I mentioned above as well as acoustic guitar and blue grass. I've been pleased with the sound quality for that type of music. I've used the speaker outside on my deck at a picnic table and it had plenty of power to fill the area. Many people describe sound quality from these type of speakers as ""tinny"" or weak, however this speaker is not like that. A great feature of the speaker is the hands free calling feature. This works seamlessly when the speaker is paired with my phone (iPhone 6+) and I'm pleased with the call sound and the microphone. The company claims this speaker is redesigned to be more powerful and have deeper bass. I agree with that claim, however my expectations are aligned with a speaker of this type and size. You should not be expecting sound like you would get from larger stereo speakers. My recommendation for the BEST performance and sound quality is to also download a high quality Equalizer App for your iPhone and use it when playing your music. The app I use is called ""Equalizer"" from Audioforge. My previous Oontz was difficult to pair, but pairing this speaker is quick and easy. The annoying blue light that was located on the front of the older Oontz has been relocated to the side panel of this speaker. My experience with battery life is about 7 -12 hours between charges. However, I would like a longer charging cord. The included USB cord is quite short (6 inches) and has to located directly near the power source. The speaker does not come with a wall charger. A 3.5 mm, 32 inch audio cable is included.  This speaker is designed to be water proof and as such the controls are on the sealed, silicone end panel and have raised ridges to help you locate them. The charging port and 3.5 mm jack port are located on the back panel of the speaker under a tight, silicone flap that's just a bit tricky to open. The sealed power button is directly above the ports. The front panel is a typical metal, perforated grill. The bass radiators are on the bottom panel along with nonskid silicone feet. Overall, I enjoy this speaker, I am pleased with its performance, the sale price was low compared to the quality and features and Cambridge is a known, established, American company. I've contacted Cambridge customer service and received prompt and expert service. The Cambridge website has plenty of resources and information as well. If you need a quality, portable speaker with great performance, give this one a try.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For what you pay and how compact this awesome little speaker is, the sound and value are amazing.I bought this to replace my portable iHome speakers that finally bit the dust. It's worth noting that those died in part because of on/off switches that would often accidentally slip on in luggage, ruining the battery; they also had rather cumbersome wires.These address those issues and more, including adding a number of great little touches:-Rubberized buttons that are water resistant-The speaker automatically shuts off if no sound is coming through them to preserve battery--unless it's already plugged in; great design feature!-Great battery life, partly because of the above point, and partly because it's just a high quality, high capacity battery-Did I mention that the sound is amazing for its size and price?! Brought this to my friend's bachelor party in Mexico and it was plenty loud for the big house we rented out. No, the speaker is not a Bose 7.1 Dolby Surround home theater set up, but it shouldn't be. It's only about 5 inches wide and costs the same as a trip to the convenience store.-Bluetooth reduces the need for cords, but also works with a standard headphone jack (and comes with the cord!), which you can use to plug into a computer, for exampleAltogether it's one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Man, this is tough to review. All 3 do a commendable job given their size and price, and based on that alone I'd give them all 5 stars. Given the sound quality itself, however, I'd say they sounded good but not great, which is why I ultimately gave each of them 4 stars - MAYBE 5 stars for the SoundCore 2. You're definitely trading some sound quality for portability.All 3 seemed well built and solid. The SoundCores were a notch heavier, and while all 3 have an Aux input jack, the SoundCores don't include the cable. The OontZ does. All 3 include a USB-based charging cable but none include a plug-in wall adapter. I thought the OontZ had better/clearer instructions, but they all easily connected to Alexa. Haven't tried anything else yet. The OontZ and SoundCore2 are ""splash"" waterproof, the SoundCore is not. The SoundCores play a short multi-note audio tone when powered on, and when connecting to a bluetooth source, with no apparent way to turn it off, but it was subdued and I didn't find it objectionable. The OontZ is silent. All 3 have raised buttons for power, volume, bluetooth, etc, but I DON'T like that they're all the same color as the case. You either have to shine a light to see them, or fumble around by feel. Annoying and unnecessary. I don't care that making them white or gray or whatever ""ruins the clean lines"" - it's a portable speaker, not a piece of furniture.Now, I'm not an audiophile, but I do understand that you're never going to get subwoofer-like bass and top quality sound from small speakers like these. For this comparison I listened to the same songs played from the same source (Alexa), at the same volume, 30 degrees off center and from about 8' away. No equalizing - just as-is straight out of Alexa.OontZ Angle 3:Louder than the SoundCores. Highs and midranges were distinctly brighter and clearer as well - actually quite impressive. Even my self-proclaimed ""tone deaf"" wife could easily hear the difference. Unfortunately, while that end of the spectrum sounded good, it also kinda drowned out whatever bass was present. You could say there was a bass ""presence"", but it was more of a ""whap"" than a ""thump"". Overall it made the sound seem a little unbalanced toward the high end.Anker SoundCore:Highs and midrange were more subdued, which is probably why it seemed quieter. Compared the OontZ this speaker sounded a little like it was laying face down in a pillow. Even when Alexa ""talked"" you could tell her voice was more muffled. That, however, allowed more of the bass to shine thru and made for a little more balanced overall sound. When a song hit a bass note it was a little more pronounced and deeper than the OontZ. Now (depending on your ""ear""), if you just walked into a room with the SoundCore playing you may not notice the more subdued highs, but right after hearing the Oontz it was quite noticeable.So bottom line, if you dig highs & midrange and don't care as much about bass, the Oontz is definitely your speaker. If you like a more balanced sound at the cost of brighter highs, the SoundCore is the way to go.Me? I'd go with the OontZ by the slightest of margins. While the SoundCore may have a slight edge in bass, the OontZ's has a bigger edge in highs - making it the better overall speaker (to me).UPDATE 10/31/2018:The SoundCore 2 arrived. Noticeably richer sound than the original SoundCore - mainly due to a fuller bass. Won't rival a sub-woofer but it was impressive for such a small speaker. Highs seemed slightly more pronounced as well (vs the original SC), but it was hard to tell if that was real or it just seemed that way next to the richer bass. Overall the fullest, richest sound of the 3 speakers, and right now my top pick. Being $10 more you'd expect it to sound at least a little better, and it does.It also adds ""splash"" waterproofing, with a convenient tab you can pull to open the rubber cover that protects the jacks. The OontZ requires some digging to lift enough of the cover to grab.

Would plug in to charge again & it wouldn’t charge at all. I hadn’t even had it 60 days!! I contacted Amazon chat & after time chatting back & forth they said I would have to ship it back & the warranty may or may not cover it. I was expecting a replacement or at least a new charger to see if that was the problem but no!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because I didn't want to replace the stereo in my 2003 car.  It's old enough that it has a 1 CD player and... a tape deck!  I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks in my car and my phone's speakers aren't loud enough to cut it.  This speaker does the trick.  The sound is really clear and is loud enough that I can listen even when I have studded snow tires on, which make my car a lot louder.  I haven't listened to any music with this yet, so I can't comment on that.I might get some Command velcro stuff to stick it to the dash, but for now, it just lives in the passenger seat.  It's also small enough to fit in my already crowded glove box.  My car has an inverter, so I can charge it right in the car, which is a nice perk.I wish I had thought of this years ago.  I'm no audiophile, but I think the sound is great and the price is right.  My one complaint, that goes for every rechargeable item, is that the battery would be hard to replace.  Batteries don't last forever so this will eventually become an expensive paperweight.  This just creates waste and makes me sad.  Rechargeable items should be designed so that the batteries are replaceable.

I wanted a small Bluetooth speaker for my laptop, this speaker fills the void that the tinny Acer laptop speakers miss. Its sound is almost as good as the echo.I've found for better bass, lay it flat, the passive radiators definitely help. We're talking basic features here, but for myself it sounds darn good for $30. As far as longevity goes, I'm on the fence, a 90 day warranty isn't the best and since a lot of reviewers pointed out, they ended up with a paper weight. Also take into consideration that close to 20,000 units have beens sold, so it's fair to say you'll end up with a few bad ones, which is why I opted to spend the three bucks for the additional warranty.I've extracted even more bass from this little guy with my phone's graphic EQ, and the sound doesn't distort or drop off either way.Don't dunk it, but yeah you could take it to the beach, just make sure the rubber flap is closed on the charging port.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Update 3 months post purchase. Now I cannot seem to keep a charge on the speaker. I'll leave it on the usb charger for several hours and it will only charge half way. I also recently took it on a road trip and it played approximately 3 hours with no problem before dying. Since dying I attempted to charge it and the sound wouldn't transfer on via Bluetooth or aux cord. Sucky thing is that it's more than 3 months beyond the warranty so I can't return it.I've had it for the past two months and think it's a great product. I've used it in the shower or generally around the house. The sounds is very loud and bright. You can monitor the sound both with the dials or through the source of the sound (e.g. phone or computer). I've used it both with my phone and with my laptop, and it does great at amplifying the sounds when I'm streaming a movie. The charge stays forever. I use it several times a week and have only charged it 2-3 times since I've purchased it.Cons- You can't toggle back and forth for different music. Only pause, and volume.- The bluetooth range doesn't do well when I'm moving it from my downstairs to upstairs without having my phone close. The sounds starts to get choppy.

The volume goes really loud so I don't think we'll have any problem with it at the party. The sound quality is very good in my opinion. It sounds clear & crisp. We've used it at bedtime & hanging out outside. The only complaint I will say, is you can't go too far away from the speaker if you have it connected to your phone (& carrying it with you) otherwise the connection goes in & out. Battery life seems good. I haven't timed it to see if it matches with what it says. But it seems to last long enough for typical use.*EDIT*We've had it for a month now.

They stay put and don't dance around on a desk vibrating.  The volume is impressive, and without distortion.I've not pushed the battery to see how long it would actually hold up until fully drained - I think the longest I've ever used it ""unplugged"" is about 3-4 hours.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not listen to the negative reviews, that is either user error or a fluke. Now, I will admit I just got this, and immediately upon seeing its size and weight I thought it was going to be cheap crap. I can’t speak to battery life yet or longevity, and I will update if needed.But let’s just say, sometimes good things DO come in small packages. Seriously, it’s not even as long as my stretched out hand (I put it next to my standard sized men’s wallet to illustrate). In the past I’ve gotten $25 Bluetooth speakers with good reputations (like the “Venstar Taco”) and found the audio quality to be terrible. I’m an audio guy, I have a nice turntable and stereo and I know what I’m looking for.Audio quality:I was astounded that this little thing could put out sound as crisp, clear, present and balanced as it does. My last good sounding bt speaker was 3x the size. For its size & price, it sounds amazing. I tried it with punk, metal, acoustic, alt rock, hip hop, and stand up comedy. It sounds great all around.IF YOU ARE A BASS-HEAD AND WANT A TON OF THUMP, this probably isn’t for you. The audio quality is great, and it’s got some punch in the low end (Queen “Another One Bites The Dust” sounds awesome, but hip hop sounds kinda tame and weak)... But I recommend you look for another oontZ with a bass boost because the sound IS good.Is it loud? It’s KIND OF LOUD. I had my phone up all the way (minus one notch) and the speaker maxed out. It did not distort for me at all, and it was as loud or slightly louder than I need it to be (I want a speaker for showering, doing things around the house, cooking etc). Would it work outside, probably if it’s close by. Could you hear it while sawing wood? Probably not. But I’d imagine it’s comparable to your average similarly priced CD player boom box. I also listen to hard rock and like it loud all of the time, I go to a lot of concerts so I like being overwhelmed by sound. So, it’s decent.Does it pair to your devices easily? Yes. It paired to my iPhone immediately, no hassle. Then without disconnecting my iPhone, I pushed the Bluetooth button on the side and my MacBook recognized it immediately and connected just a couple seconds later. There was no “I have to go to settings and disconnect my phone first, then go through a connect process again with another device”, it’s quick and painless.I definitely recommend, and I would buy this again.

After using this speaker for about a month, I have come to the conclusion that there is no way almost 36,000 people would give this 4.5 stars; something is amiss.  I should have followed the adage of ""if it's too good to be true, it probably isn't"". In this case, the reviews are not close to reality.I purchased this speaker hoping to save a few bucks over the cost of another speaker like the Wonderboom speaker another member of our family has.  I was immediately disappointed in this OontZ Angle 3 for two reasons.  Most importantly, the sound produced by the speaker is no better than the sound produced by my I phone 8.  There is very little base sound and ""tinny"" overall sound is VERY disappointing. I don't consider myself a sound aficionado, nor do I consider myself a speaker snob; I just want a good full sound from a speaker.  Also, this speaker's volume is only able to be controlled by the phone so if the phone is not immediately available, there is no way to lower, or increase, the volume.Save yourself don't waste your hard earned money on this lame excuse for a bluetooth speaker.

I'm a little flabbergasted how easy it was to set up this device. From signing for the delivery to singing along with the rock'n'roll took about ten minutes.Most important, though, is the sound, and I had my doubts. I work 13-hour shifts and wanted to hear my tunes in a *loud* workplace, before and after my 9-5 colleagues go home. But my desk is only about 15 feet from the roaring HVAC unit that makes luxuries like *thinking* and conversation with coworkers difficult.Well, to my honest surprise, this affordable and silly-named ""OontZ Angle 3"" delivers. It puts out sound that's clear and foot-tappable. and even at 100% volume, there's no distortion. But I had to turn it down; it was too loud. It's now set at about 75% of its maximum volume, and that's enough to defeat the HVAC, even when I'm at the distant end of the room. I'm planning to buy a second unit for my home.PS.

It is labeled for 5V 1 Amp, comes with a USB to Micro cord of about 18 inches. This Oontz does not come with a charger. Manual claims 6 hours to fully charge and 12 hours play time at 2/3rds volume.Water resistance is IPX5, which the manual says is splash resistance only, no puddles, do not submerge.Manual does not describe any other uses than as a stereo speaker.""Crystal Clear Stereo Sound"". Uhhh, no. Very little channel separation, left driver is 3/8"" from the right driver, my ears are spaced further apart than that. Each ear hears both left AND right.Is it worth the money? Yeah, I think it is, but my only other BT speakers are about the same SOUND quality and 2/3rds the price.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the speaker because I listen to either music or stories all the time, working in the garden, taking showers , at the beach. I got it for Christmas this year and loved it until a month ago when it's simply stopped working. The red and blue lights indicate it is taking a charge. But it will not connect to my phone anymore. It's hard to believe that at only 4 months old oh, the manufacturer wants no part of replacing it. So if you're lucky and yours works you'll be very happy. If you're like so many of us other ones, it's going to stop working and you're going to be sad like me

Then tried to turn on one day , nothing,blue charging life would not even illuminate. This is my second electronic device from china, and they both quit after a short period.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great size, easy to connect, no tech issues or errors.  Overall, the sound is great and this speaker gets loud without any problematic distortion at high volumes. I found the mids a bit too strong (though they are clear) and the bass to be lacking. The treble seems about right - perhaps a bit bright but definitely not harsh.  I'm not sure how people can say this thing has good bass, even for its size.  I was not expecting much bass at all from this speaker given it's size, but there are comparable speakers out there that do have more bass (e.g. jbl core, anker soundcore). However, those speakers come at a higher price point and often the sound is more directional and fire sound forward, not up or 360 degres around. Plus, the bass in other speakers often comes with more distortion at higher volume levels.  For this speaker's intended use for me, I'd rather have clear, loud sound than more bass that sounds bad when cranking the volume up.The build quality on this unit is just great.So overall, for the price, I'm pretty pleased. I didn't want to spend too much money on a speaker like this.  If it somehow had a touch more bass I'd give it 5 stars.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am skeptical of any claims of high quality audio from basically any Bluetooth speaker but I needed one and came across this one and gave it a shot. While it lacks the power and obviously size to reproduce high fidelity audio it does a surprisingly good job considering the odds stacked against it. Definitely one of the best Bluetooth speakers in this price point which is pretty reasonable. Is it a couple hundred dollar Bose or something along those lines? No but for the price its a dang good little speaker.Update 8/24/19Our first one is still going strong and we have purchased a second. The sound quality definitely is better when using the 3.5 mm connection but the volume definitely seems lower. Unless you need the extra volume because of an overly noisy environment I would suggest trying the speaker this way. Still happy with our purchase which is why we picked up a second.

We had one of those old speakers where you have to plug your phone in and I was getting sick of not being able to use my phone when at the beach/pool because it was plugged in. This was the perfect solution! Not only can I use my phone no because it's bluetooth. BUT it's waterproof and sand proof. No more crackly speakers this one has super clear audio and can get really loud too! Can you tell I'm not a tech nerd :) I don't know much about technology but for me this was such an awesome solution. Also really love how quick my phone can connect to it. Took like 15 seconds for me to figure out how to connect it! Because it's waterproof we can leave it on our patio all the time too. We obviously have super high humidity and torrential downpours all the time so I don't have to worry about this. When we're ready to party all i have to do is turn it on and put the play list on! Plus you seriously can't beat the cost!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"It was becoming quite tedious to unplug and plug my speakers every time I wanted to listen to music in another room. Therefore, I wanted a wireless speaker that I could easily grab around the house, for when Im taking a shower, cooking, working, etc.This speaker does the job. However, the sound quality is nothing to boast about, its basically louder and slightly better than my cellphone (I have an iphone5), which is not great for a speaker. Anytime I play anything with something of a bass, or high note/pitch, these speakers do not play it super well and there is slight distortion.My other speaker which was not wireless where just basic desk top speakers, and somehow the sound played better out of them..In essence, this speaker does the job. The ease of moving these around and the ok price tag, makes me keep them and accept the sometimes distortion of sound.

The Oontz Angle 3 plays mostly music. Pretty manageable in general, solid range, dexterous, and holds up well in sunlight. I put this bad boy in the bottom of my tub filled with water for over 12 hours. Well it didn't work after so I bought another and tried 8 hours. That one also broke so I bought a third and tried 6 hours. Same thing so dropped it to 4. This time it held up and worked after so I tried 5 and it died. Drew the line below 5 above 4. So there's your marker if you are looking to drop it in the lake for a bit although I'm not sure why you would want to do that. If that is your goal maybe find an under water speaker and don't rely on this you weirdo.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this speaker.  I bought it because it was cheaper than similar speakers.  It's a good looking portable speaker and it doesn't draw a lot of attention to itself.  I think I generally get 8-10 hours of play time from it, depending on how loud I have it set.  This is enough playback time for me.  It feels light and well built. Connecting via bluetooth is easy and simple.  The reason it receives three stars is sound quality.  It can be a little muddled at mid-volume.  I'm not looking for perfection from a small, cheap speaker but my old Bem speaker did a better job at moderate volume.  Granted, this is all based on personal preference so it might sound fine to you.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in July, and was initially very pleased with the sound, either cabled or bluetooth, the portability, and toughness/waterproof characteristics.  So, after a few months, scratch the ""toughness"" aspect, because like others have noted, and with SO many other products out there, the USB port is mechanically flimsy and after repeated use fatigues and fails.  Why Cambridge Soundworks, like so many other manufacturers, insist on employing USB when all it's used for is power, is beyond me.  Great sound and battery life for the price, but if it's only going to last 3 months I would expect Cambridge Soundworks to take some heat for the number of these things that will be littering the landfills in short order.EDIT:  From 1 Star, to 3.  Based entirely on the response and support from Cambridge Soundworks. (see the comments to this review).  Cambridge Soundworks acted quickly to this issue, and offered a replacement unit.  I received it less than a week ago.  3-Stars from 1 is a good bump.  But the replacement unit has the same somewhat flimsy USB port for charging the unit, so I'm withholding a better rating until I see how this one holds up.  I also asked about disposal of the original but haven't rec'd. an answer to that question; if these thing are basically disposable that would be horrific, since I'm pretty sure that whatever these are made of has no business being in a landfill or the oceans.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have only had this speaker one day so I don't have a lot of run time with it.  Here's what I've discovered.  I've tried it with my MacBook Air, iPad, iPhone and HP Spectre. The Bluetooth function pairs quickly with all of my devices.  I also have a Bose SoundLink and the OontZ connects even quicker.  The problem I have is when using it with my MacBook connected to an external monitor.  Then the Bluetooth not only sounds awful with a lot of static, it also interferes with the signal and cuts out the video.  However, if I use the 3.5mm audio cable, it works just fine. The reason I bought this is that MacBooks cut out the sound when using an external monitor.  So you need a speaker like this.  I'm OK with the cable,  just would have preferred using the Bluetooth.It appears to be well constructed.  Haven't run down the battery yet to see how long a charge will last.  It's very easy to set up.  I like it's small size - doesn't take up much space on my desk.  The sound quality is very good for a small speaker - not as good as the Bose, but certainly adequate.  And for the price, it's a pretty good deal.I'll update my review after I get more experience with the speaker.Update March 20, 2019I've now been using this speaker for about 3 weeks and have seen no significant changes.  It works well in Bluetooth mode with all of my devices except my MacBook Air where it has a lot of static.  It does work just fine with the MacBook Air when using the 3.5 mm cable. I've tried it with my wife's MacBook air and my daughter's MacBook air and get the same static in Bluetooth.  So, it's not just my computer.  Other than that, it's a good value for the money.  Seems to be holding up well.  After three weeks of constant use, I still have not had to recharge it.  So, battery life is great.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this and everything was perfect.I used it on top of the showcase when we had mini parties and when I cooked. Great sound and battery. Recently. I tried using it around Christmas and the sound was terrible, like mono. So I figured it was the batteries because it was very low. I fully charged it, and tried again twice, but the battery does not charge very well and even when the battery is charged, it doesn't last. The worst part, the speaker sound is officially busted. It sounds like something from the intercom system back during the war times as seen in movies. The only time I brought it down from the showcase is to charge the batteries, which I would say is no more than a handful because battery did last really well on one charge, and I use it like once a week or every other week for maybe half hour at most. Now it doesn't even charge well and the charge doesn't hold past half hour. Very disappointing because I really liked this while it lasted. I bought this in the summer so it lasted me about 6 months before the speaker busted. Two stars because I did love it before it died.***Update:I just want to say customer service is EXCEPTIONAL. I wish I had reached out to them before I left a poor review, but they reached out and replaced my speaker. I have not yet used it, but I am sure it will be fine because like I said in my previous review, I had loved the speaker even before it died. Thank you so much for following up.

It was a little tricky connecting it the first time but after that as long as you pair it with the Alexa command and then start playing the audio it works good.  I paired it with my phone too but tried to raise the volume with the plus key and it skipped to the next song.  I don't like that the power button is invisible and hard to find.  I don't like that you can't tell how much charge it has left.  I wish it had like 5 dots that lit up and went down for every 20% of power left.The sound is very good, even loud it's not distorted.  I like to hear news channels from Tune in when I'm in the shower and my bathroom has a fan that turns on when I turn the light on and I can barely hear my tablet when that happens, but with this I can hear it even when the fan and shower is running.  It's also good that it's splash proof in case I drip on it while I'm toweling off.  I also like that you can turn it off and then Alexa disconnects and I can hear the audio in my living room thru the echo dot.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This angle 3 pretty much lives up to the description. The sound quality is excellent, the battery is great, and I like the style. Unfortunately, they put the audio-in port right next to the power port. This means if you're using your unit in analog audio mode AND you're charging, you get significant output noise, even when no audio is playing. It's a real bummer. To make the line noise go away, either don't charge the unit, or use only bluetooth.Speaking of bluetooth, this unit does not play well with non-premium brand bluetooth. Yes, it's great for iPhone. But, for Android and PCs with bluetooth, audio quality may stutter, and connectivity may suddenly fail.Really, the OontZ Angle 3 is meant to be used with premium equipment. I would have eliminated the audio in aux port, and simply required the latest bluetooth without any version compatibility fallback. For those of us who want to use an Oontz in a desktop PC environment, we should look elsewhere.

You can get the Amazon basics small black speaker and it's pretty good for 20 bucks, poor quality on the high end for sound and little to no low end base to speak of...but still good.This however is a great purchase for the money.

The battery lasts quite a long time especially if you're not at full blast. The sound quality itself all the way up from low to high is really good. It isn't the loudest speaker in the world, I tried to hear it over my snowmobile and it wasn't happening but I wasn't expecting to be able to either. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's annoying to tell whether or not it is on or off making Bluetooth connection a hair frustrating. Sometimes it makes a on noise sometimes it doesn't. But other than that it is a great little speaker for in the woods, working on a car, or at work. Oh and I was able to hear it pretty well at a large skate park but there were only a handful of people there making noise.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an excellent speaker for listening to audiobooks. The sound quality is rich and deep, which helps you hear the voices even if they are muffled or high-pitched. The buttons are soft and easy to push and locate. It also has a decent speaker phone. The small size and flexibility (horizontal or vertical) make it easy to set anywhere as I move around. Since the the volume between the speaker and the phone are independent there is a great deal more flexibility with volume. It can be very loud when I’m gardening. And very quiet when I’m falling asleep. The sleep timer also comes in very handy. After the timer turns off my audiobook, the speaker turns  off after 15 minutes of no activity. Awesome!  It’s very comfortable to carry around. I also love that it’s Bluetooth connection signal is quiet and pleasant. The water resistance is also very handy if I need to touch it while doing the dishes. I highly recommend this speaker for audiobook listeners!

There are days where I start playing music when I wake up in the morning and I don't need to start charging it until dinner time or later. I've used it outside while working in the yard and the sound projects a surprising distance considering the size of this thing, and with no distortion! To reiterate that last point, this thing can get LOUD, especially indoors. No problems with the Bluetooth pairing, very simple to manage. Bass is directed downwards and seems to reflect off of whatever it is sitting on, so you will get better sound when placed on a hard surface. When on a hard surface, the bass sounds quite good for the price of this thing. You definitely lose out on some audio quality when this is on soft surface like a couch/bed or in your hand, it is very noticeable when you place it on a proper surface. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality Bluetooth speaker at a very reasonable price.

But other reviewers' claims of good bass response are crazy talk. I guess compared to a cell phone that may be correct, but even compared to a normal Echo (not Dot) this thing is weak in the bass department, to the point that I find listening to it really annoying and unpleasant. The thing is, it shakes and vibrates like it's really working hard, so I even went so far as to open it up to verify that the speakers hadn't been wired out of phase, but nope they were wired correctly. I'll probably add a woofer output jack, but in reality I'll probably end up giving it to Goodwill.

Connecting to my PC or smartphone is simple and the volume is very good as well.It would be a five star item except for a couple of things. While I understand the effort to make the speaker water resistant the small rubber ""press in place"" cover over the USB charging port is a bit fussy to press into place and stay there. Also, the waterproof on/off membrane switch seems like a delicate thing that could prove to be a weak point going forward. Time will tell.

The only critique is I wish I could have bought 2 to pair together to get a stereo effect with music. I bought this for my car (which has no bluetooth) and I bought two Aomais Sport II for my home office. I love the OontZ better than the Aomais for ease of use and pairing. I have had trouble pairing with the Aomais and though I like the sound prompts of the latter,, it is really annoying to hear ""charging"" repeatedly when I'm trying to use it while charging! Why would they design a prompt like that? So OontZ gets my vote hands down.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this exclusively in the shower in my small bathroom.  I purchased this to replace a speaker that I have had for about 3 years. It was a small 5-watt outdoor speaker from Aukey that had since been discontinued. The battery life started to deteriorate, so I started to look for a slightly better sound on a budget, and of course, better battery life.  After some research I settled on the Oontz.  This speaker more than fits the bill!a) SOUND: The sound is fuller than my previous speaker, doesn't distort, and with 10 watts of power, it is LOUDER (especially in a small room, i.e. bathroom).b) BATTERY: The battery life is phenomenal! I know I only use it for about 25 minutes a day, but I love having to charge it only once a month at most. The remaining battery charge conveniently appears in my phone's Bluetooth settings which helps me keep track of it.c) WIRELESS RANGE: Big improvement over my previous speaker.  The Oontz has a 100 foot range (unobstructed); I can keep my phone charging in one room while playing music in the shower.  I couldn't do this reliably before.d) CONTROLS:  Button layout works well.  The volume and track controls share the same 2 buttons but it's a simple matter of press vs press and hold.  Play and pause are on the same button as well.  You have one button for phone call and Bluetooth controls: answer and end calls (with one press), reject calls (press and hold) and pairing mode (press and hold).  You have a dedicated power button and it is alone on another side of the speaker (with the auxiliary input jack and charging port), you will not accidentally power the speaker off when trying to operate any of the other buttons.  You have 2 LED lights, a red one by the power button and a blue one with the other controls.  These lights prove useful when determining the status of certain functions and features.e) FLEXIBLE: You can use this with any bluetooth device (wirelessly) or use it with any device with a headphone jack via the auxiliary input jack (wired).  You can use it while plugged into the charger, or not.  You can keep it plugged in without any detrimental effects to the battery (per the manufacturer) if you're interested in using this with an Amazon Echo Dot or the like.f) PRICE: All of this for a very reasonable price.  The same price, in fact, that I paid for the Aukey speaker I had previously.I was so impressed with this little speaker that I purchased one of it's big brothers, The Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, not too longer after!

I mainly listen to jazz/rock fusion and progressive rock (among the various fashions of music), and the work that these musicians place on recording is performed with detail and intricacy, and for the listener to appreciate the effort achieved in the works, far more is required from the system than one dinky little micro-speaker can produce.Incomes the OontZ Gen 3 Bluetooth Speaker system, and no more sad reminders of how much I’ve missed the full, rich blend of bass, midrange, and treble tonalities. This unit’s output is far more than are my simple needs of bringing music to my home patio or kitchen. One might imagine his daughter cranking up some cray cray hip hop on this beast.A word to the wise (or, even if you’re a couple fries short an order): get a nice graphic equalizer to bring the sound together. They’re easy to use and graphic equalizers make all the difference in the world. The OontZ Gen 3 pumps A LOT of lower-range bass, and you may need to adjust the volumes on both your device and the OontZ Gen 3. I personally lowered the volume on the OontZ Gen 3 to a little more than halfway up, and I do all the volume controlling from my device; it’s easier that way IMO.So, whether you listen to the Dixie Dregs or the Dixie Chicks, this speaker system will make your little heart happy, AND IT’S SO INEXPENSIVE!Perfect price!

Plus it's kinda cute, the shape is structurally smart (resistant to tipping over) and it has great little non-skid feet that really keep it in place. Only it's longevity remains to be seen...

4.0 out of 5 stars,"PROS:This speaker works well enough when connected to my phone via bluetooth or the included audio cable. It is louder than I expected it to be while connected to my phone (galaxy s8).CONS:The volume is NOT great when I cast my screen and audio to a monitor, then run the audio to the speaker from the monitor. I'm not sure why there would be a difference between my phone and the monitor's volume projections. There must be some disconnect with the monitor and speaker's compatibility. I don't have a newer monitor to try it on, but it's possible that my (several year old) monitor doesn't work great with this technology.The speaker great for the price, and really does work perfectly when connected with my phone. I just wish it was more universal with older devices/monitors (if that is indeed the problem). I like to watch things while I cook, and thought I could use this speaker in combination with the monitor, but the volume is too low to be able to heard clearly over the various sounds of cooking.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this simply because of all of the great reviews boasting ""great quality sound!"" and because the price had been reduced to $27.99 from $99.99. I also needed to replace my old Bluetooth speaker that my wife accidentally dropped into the pool. I'm completely disappointed in this product. The sound quality is nowhere near what the raving 5 star writers would lead you to believe. I wasn't expecting professional quality sound, but I was expecting better than what I got. The speaker sounds exactly like you would expect a small cheap speaker to sound like: small and cheap. My old Bluetooth speaker was the Etekcity RoverBeats T3 Ultra Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker, CSR 4.0. It was $19.99 and is superior to this product in every way.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update - I have owned this speaker for two years now. It still sounds great.  I am still amazed at the sound that comes from this compact speaker.If you are wondering if the reviews are to good to be true STOP WORRYING and buy this speaker before Cambridge SoundWorks realizes they priced it too low.I was trying to find a new Bluetooth speaker for my wife as a birthday gift. The Logitec that we owned for several years just didn't sound like it used to. In addition to the Bluedio BS-3 I also purchased the Cabridge SoudWorks OontZ Angle 3, and the UE Roll (1st Generation). If you are wondering, the Cambridge SoundWorks had the best sound in my opinion regardless of price.When we received all three speakers my wife insisted I participate in a blind listening test. I am a cheap skate and she was convinced I would favor the cheaper speaker (she did not know the prices when we listened to them). We found an article online with song recommendations for testing speakers and headphones. We listened to Caribbean Blue by Enya (not a fan but a good song to test the speakers), Brass Monkey by Beasty Boys, and Unfinished Sympathy by Massive Attack. I also added Falling Slowly from the Once soundtrack as it has good female and male vocals in the same song, as well as acoustic guitar.ResultsBluedio BS-3 - This speaker was easily identified as the 3rd Place speaker. While it sounded fine there was not a single song I listened to where it stood out. The one area where I felt this speaker excelled was in volume. You could leave this speaker on the kitchen counter and hear it clearly in the living room 30 feet away. The only negative was a constant soft static sound in the back ground. If I had not been comparing side by side I might not have noticed it. Had this speaker been less expensive than the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angel 3 I might have considered it.UE Roll (1st Generation) - The UE Roll was a very good speaker and definitely a good value at $67. My wife and I did not share our opinions with each other as we progressed through the listening test. The amazing thing was that we both had identical thoughts about all three speakers. Our first impression was that the UE Roll had the best sound. However when we narrowed it down to the a head to head contest with the Oonz Angle 3 we realized it had very different sound from the other speakers. The only way I can describe it is that the Roll sounds like it is under a thin lid. There is a slightly muffled echo aspect to the sound. The more I listened, the more I noticed, and I did not like it. Again had I purchased this speaker on its own I would have liked it just fine. It is also possible mine was a one off for UE.Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3 - When I told my wife that this speaker was only $30 she didn't believe me.Seriously how is this speaker $30!!! She has a Bose speaker in her office at work. This speaker is no where near as good as the Bose, but my wife appreciates good sound. The Oontz Angle 3 sounds great. The funny thing is that I almost eliminated it from consideration listening to Brass Monkey because I thought it had a harsh sound to it. I later realized that it was just the jarring differences of the UE Roll. The Roll's slightly muffled sound made the Angle 3 sound harsh in comparison.If you are looking for a Bluetooth speaker under $100 the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3 is a great choice. The best part is that it is only $30!!!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really happy with this speaker overall. I bought it primarily based on price and the water resistance rating. This is for use outdoors, and I didn't want to kick myself if I accidentally left it outside overnight.Pros:- Great build quality. It feels really solid.- Volume is impressive for such a small speaker.- High range is very clear.- Bluetooth pairing is super fast, maybe takes 2 seconds at the most.Cons:- I was not impressed with the bass, as some other reviewers seem to have been. It's mostly non-existent.- Mid-range sounds a bit muddy at times.One minor personal gripe: I wish the micro-USB was a bit more recessed under the rubber seal. I use cables with interchangeable, magnetic tips so I can charge everything with the same cable. Unfortunately, I can't put one of the micro-USB tips in the port because it would cause the cover to stay open. It's not a dealbreaker, and most people probably won't care.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wasn't expecting too much for the price point here but it definitely exceeded. The angle is pretty en-genius. I like to point my smaller bluetooth speakers toward the wall or any flat surface because the sound seems to bounce back louder. I normally have to place something under the front of a speaker to give it an upward angle to maximize the affect. This speaker already has the angle so this works particularly well. Most speakers I have bought in the past that have good bass seems to come at the cost of a decent midrange sound. This speaker has plenty have bass and seems balanced with treble and mid as well. Which is great if you ever listen to anything other than rap. Doesnt get distorted at max volume either. I really liked the doss touch wirless v4.0 bluetooth speaker and got on to purchase another but after seeing the reviews on this one decided to give it a try. They are extremely close in sound quality but have to give the win to the OontZ angle because is smaller, so easier to travel with. It also seems a little bit less distorted at max volume than the doss. (the doss may have a tiny bit more bass but not much at all) Overall a great design and great sound at an unbeatable price.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Alright, so I got this during the Cyber Monday sale.I had some really nice speakers with old roommates, but they belonged to them (bummer). So when I moved into my own place, I didn't know how much I wanted to invest. I figured that I'd start small and go from there. I'm SO glad I did.This speaker is crazy powerful, but small. It turns off by itself if you're not using it, which is a huge plus because I constantly forget to turn stuff off (yikes). A full battery charge lasts four to five days, even if you are using it 12 hours (about my usage). And it will tell you if it needs a charge by flashy a red light at you. It's not annoying or anything, but not subtle either.The reasons I took a star off: the aux cord that came with it will absolutely break (it's short anyways) plus the blutooth capabilities are meh.I had actually bought an extra auxiliary cord because I knew I would want a much longer cord, which I did. Ended up being a wise choice when the one that came with the speaker broke. And even if my phone is within a foot of it, the blutooth cuts out. Which sucks, but isn't a real issue for me.Tldr; Besides a couple of forgivable flaws, totally worth it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this thing. Very compact, but very powerful for its size. I use this when I am outside sitting around the fire pit, and it is loud.  My daughter has basically claimed this thing, and I may need to order another one. It was left outside overnight in a very light sprinkle of rain (more like a slight misting) and woke up to dew on the ground. The amount of moisture, which wasn’t much, had no effect on it. I highly recommend this. It has a long lasting battery, excellent sound, great volume and a better value than comparable speakers costing more. I have tried Altec Lansing, Bose and Anker, and I thought this one sounded much better.  Although, the Anker was a close competition.  I was steered away from that one because of connectivity and battery life issues from the one I tested.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Originally I rated this speaker with a one star rating and my thoughts about its quality .... a volume issue. A day or two later I received a very nice email from a Customer Service Representative stating that my comments were noticed and the company wanted to provide a few hints as to what my issue might be.  I reviewed the list and experimented with their suggestions.  Immediately the volume was where I expected it to be.  My issue was ""Operator Error"".  Today I would rate this speaker as a 5-Star item.  I believe the quality of the speaker and the company should actually be rated higher.  If you are looking for a good looking, powerful speaker that is worth far more than the selling price .... THIS IS IT.I highly recommend this speaker.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Before I start, don't read this review if you expect a glowing recommendation, you won't.So I had reasonably high expectations for this device since it was by Cambridge Works, a brand I had familiarity with many years ago for their quality of materials, reliability and good sound.  One out of three is not great.Build quality is pretty good.  Sound quality is, meh, average, not earth shattering but then for the price it is rather over sold.  Let's not pretend it's anything but sub-par sound.However, the reliability of the unit is not good.  I am on my second one now and it suffers the same issue the first one did and others seem to of complained about.  Randomly, the unit will cause the sound stream to pause, restart itself and now you have to manually start the stream again.  No other Bluetooth Audio device I've owned has ever exhibited this problem and shouldn't.  Since this second one has the same problem (I tried both my iPad, iPhone and PC Laptop, all same problem) I will now return it and find another brand that doesn't over hype itself then fall very short.  Buyer beware!

I bought this on a whim while it was on sale - and it turned out to be a great decision.I have been using a JBL Flip 4 in my office to listen to music, podcasts, etc. on a low volume while working at my desk.  The one major downside to the JBL Flip 4 is that every time I turn it on or off, the 'connect', 'disconnect' and 'power on' and 'power off' sounds are VERY LOUD and they cannot be altered (at least not that I've found) and it is distracting to others.The OontZ has clear sound, it's small footprint and size are perfect for my application, the connection sound is not distracting or loud and the Bluetooth works flawlessly.  I haven't listened to anything at a moderate or loud setting yet so I can't comment on sound quality beyond a volume setting of '4'.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and I would buy it again.  It's a great speaker that is very intuitive to set up and very easy to use!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"While my out-of-pocket was substantially lower than the asking price (I only spent $10, thanks to an instant coupon and a prepaid Visa rebate from an unrelated purchase), the Angle 3 is still merely an OK speaker.Sound is veerrrrry mid-range-y, and surprisingly even pales compared to the entry-level--and single-speakered!--Sony SRS-XB01 (I primarily used the XB01 for comparison, as it's the closest competitor I own) and is absolutely blown away by the JBL Flip 3/4 speakers. Now, the asking price for the Angle 3 is about 1/3 to 1/4 of the JBLs, but is only a few bucks more than the Sony. And while sacrificing solid bass and scooped mids, what those few dollars exactly gets you is twofold: Volume and battery life. The Oontz has a great battery (a dozen or more hours, vs the XB01's 5-6hrs)! And it's quite a bit louder to boot.You may be asking, ""Why did you give it 4 stars then?"" Well, I didn't exactly get it for music listening. My purpose for this speaker is to use at my couch with a DIY synthesizer setup (a Gakken SX-150mkII, hacked with a custom-built 400mm softpot controller, into a Zoom effects pedal), and in that capacity it works amazingly well. It's funny how intended use can influence desired outcome!All in all, had I bought the Oontz Angle 3 to use for listening to music, I likely would have returned it and put that credit toward a better (albeit more expensive) option. But for the reason I bought it, it is good enough if not great, especially considering what I paid.The questions I'd ask you to ask yourself are these: ""Am I shopping for something to use with my phone's Prime/Spotify/etc. streaming?"" and, ""Can I swing forty to fifty bucks more for a speaker that just plain sounds better?"" If the answer to either or both of these is ""Yes,"" then I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a compact BT speaker.But I like the Angle 3 nonetheless.

So when I needed a second speaker, I went straight to the Oontz line.  What I don't like about this design is mostly due to making it water resistant.  The buttons and connections have been relocated to the upper corner on the back.I generally use this with audio cable because the charge on my nano lasts longer than when using bluetooth.  The audio cable connection is not a good location on that top back corner, it sticks out and is in the way.  (much better when located at the bottom of the back).The on/off button is hard to push as it is small and covered with the waterproof material.  The Oontz Angle has more of a sliding on/off switch which is easier to use.The sound with the audio cable is not as loud as it is on my original Oontz Angle.  However, if you use the Angle 3 with bluetooth you DO get the expected volume of sound with this speaker.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, I bought this item quite a while ago (over a year ago), but I figured I'd leave a quick review of it now. Overall, for the money, this is an excellent little speaker. I use it in a very limited fashion. Basically, it's my bathroom (specifically SHOWER) speaker: I take this speaker into the shower with me, and set it on the ledge (it doesn't get wet from the shower there, but it's exposed to lots of humidity, and my wet hands), and use it to listen to NPR in the mornings. That's it. And for this purpose, it's great. Meets my needs perfectly. I chose this speaker because it has great clarity on vocals, and doesn't have TOO MUCH bass, like some speakers from the more major manufacturers. For example, I also have the JBL Charge 3, but it has WAY too much bass for this purpose. I also had the JBL Clip 2, which had the same problem. The Oontz Angle 3, despite its claims of ""Rich Bass"", I find to be more well-balanced, and I specifically bought it BECAUSE it doesn't have too much bass. It's very durable (mine has met with the floor several times, and is still going strong, even a year later), is waterproof, and has great sound for my specific needs. And it's incredibly affordable! I would buy another one if I needed it, but I don't. Not yet, anyway. So, I actually can't offer an opinion of how this speaker performs with music. But for talk radio & podcasts, I found it to be excellent, and great value for money.

I didn't have a measuring tape, but I had the music playing from my laptop in the basement and the speaker on the 2nd floor still playing without issue.  I went to the deck which has to be 60 feet away, again no problem.When the speaker arrived it had a charge and I began using.  Then overnight I charged up completely and used over an entire weekend.  I had a major project to do downstairs and had it playing for at least 8 hours Saturday and Sunday.

Putting it on speakerphone at a table with about 5 people definitely strained its capability.  Spreading out anymore and we would have had trouble hearing the conversation and being heard on the mic.  Using it in the bathroom is excellent however.  I have generally used it in the shower several times a week for the last 2 years.  Plenty loud enough, with headroom to spare.  It has survived plenty of splashing and wet hands.  And, battery life is great.The only annoyance is when I play audiobooks.  Oftentimes the reader will pause between paragraphs or sentences.  If the pause is long enough, the speaker appears to ""sleep"" to save battery.  Waking back up takes less than a second, but is long enough that it will often miss the first word of sentences or paragraphs.  Some books are much worse than others (depending on the reader).

The instructions clearly state that the auto turnoff does not work with the Alexa.So, if using it with the Dot or Alexa system, you have to turn it off manually after use.

In a house maybe you get 20 feet.Sound is good to great giving the voice the needed bass that is missing in most small speakers.Battery does NOT last so it has to be connected to power USB at all times to operate.If volume is turned up to loudest the battery sags and it may turn itself off to recharge and looses bluetooth connection. battery.Poor Support: They do not allow me to submit a support question even though I entered all required info so they are apparently stone-walling and not answering.  Poor product.  Poor company.

It doesn't charge properly any longer or maintan a connection. Often the sound is garbled.  Being in a nursing home and bedridden it is very difficult for me to simply go to the post office and return it n the other hand, in a nursing home our money is hard to come by. I pray you can resolve my issue although I certainly don't see how. I'm unable to simply order another onebas again money is tight here. I was surprised to notice any problems, leave alone such serious ones as I have used your other products with great pleasure. Kindly let me know what I can do and if you can, kindly make my problem go away. Thank you kindly for taking the time to read this and Godwilling you can help me. Blessngs, Peter Krastins

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had several of these small BT speakers.  Some are simply trash, others are better.  My expectations for such a small package are not very high.  This one has changed my view!I like the design.  The triangular shape gets the speakers aimed up away from the surface it is sitting on.  The corners are protected and the it has soft feet to keep it where you place it.The sound quality is pretty amazing for such a small speaker.  It is not going to rattle the windows with huge bass but has enough bass to keep the sound from being thin and tinny.  The mids and highs are acceptable, given the price point.  I was pretty impressed with the amount of noise this little speaker makes.  Again, for the money invested, it does a good job.The most impressive part of the Oontz, for me, is the battery life.  I have played this thing for more than 9 hours on a single charge with no issue.  Never has a BT speaker go that long!!!If you are looking for a small speaker with pretty good sound and volume, the OontZ is a good choice

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this speaker ever day.  Every day.  I listen to Youtube videos or Spotify while cleaning, showering, doing makeup, cooking, and working.  This speaker is CRAZY loud!  I can hear it clear across the house!  One left the house to go to college, and Spouse ""borrowed"" mine for his commute to work. So this is my 3rd--my mom bought one too.  How such high quality sounds comes from such a small speaker is bewildering.  Spouse is obsessed with movie soundtracks and the garage windows rattle when he cranks up the volume!  We have a cruddy store bought speaker we use nightly for thunderstorm sounds from Youtube and the quality difference is painful.  I love everything about this speaker!  The charge lasts for days with heavy use, and it lives on the edge of my bathtub most days (you get some great acoustics from the echo!)  I can use it in my noisy warehouse and hear every word spoken--it is just amazing.  If you are a person who wanders about listening to podcasts, videos, or music--this is perfect.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a solid little Bluetooth speaker, the only negative for me is that I always carry it in my backpack, and it constantly turns on by itself. In other words if the power button just barely bumps into anything it turns on. I constantly have to open my backpack and dig it out (which is hard to do because my backpack is pure black, and I can't see the speaker against the pure black) and turn it off multiple times a day because I hear it turn on. The volume level is ok, and certainly a big improvement over an iPhone or ipad's volume limit, but if you want something really loud, this isn't the unit for you. For that you might need a BTS that plugs in. Battery life is actually pretty good if you only use it on occasion like I do. I can go a week or two without recharging it (but I only use it for a few minutes here and there, I use it primarily as part of my work, not for recreational listening).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I never used a a Bluetooth speaker before so I didn't know quite what to expect. I must say that this speaker exceeded my expectations in usability, the quality, and sound. The instructions that come with this are very clear and easy to understand. The speaker does everything the instructions say it will do when you pair it to whatever device you were going to use it with. I use it in the bathroom while taking a shower but I don't let it get wet. I can hear it just fine from the bathroom sink even with the shower running! I added a small piece of velcro to the bottom so that I can move it around in my car, which doesn't have speakers, to prevent the Sun from beating down on it during the 100-plus degree days we've been having over here in the east. All that is to say, I don't bully it,so I don't know for sure how well it will do if you bully it. For $30 bucks it can't be beat.Let me also give a shout out to the excellent customer service by Cambridge sound. I had a small issue that they addressed quickly and effectively and solved for me with no hesitation.I couldn't be happier with them or the speaker. 100% satisfied!Amazon...You've done it again!😊

4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's reasonably loud, small and stays charged for decent time (few days of occasional use.It connected right after setup and stayed for few hours. Then it disappeared and took m some time to reconnect. Then it happened few more times and I had to ""forget"" the device and reconnect again. Even restart the comp. It was very annoying and not acceptable. But then these problems disappear and even tho it sometimes disconnect, t connects back by itself (and it's very rare and for a minute or so). Otherwise, I'm listening on my comp speakers, switch this speaker on and it almost seamlessly connects to it and switch the sound from comp speakers to this. The comp even keeps volume levels different form it's own speakers and this speaker. So the overall volume actually stays the same during this switch.So overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It could b louder, could have indicator of charge and could have no connection issues, so 4 stars.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just opened and fired it up so I can’t attest to the battery or this device’s longevity, but I can say this:1.  I turned it on and paired it to my phone, which took literally 3 seconds, and it started to play.  Ive had lots of Bluetooth speakers and none connected as painlessly as this one - it just worked.2.  The sound coming out of this device is impressive.  It’s about the size of a soda can, prism shaped with eased edges (no pointy corners).  The lows are better than you’d expect, and mids are good.  I’d prefer crisper highs but overall the sound is better than the Bose which costs 3 Xs as much, is 50% bigger, and is difficult to connect to my phone.  It’s as good as the boom 3 which costs 6 Xs what I paid for this one.3.  It’s pretty loud.  You’d expect a tiny speaker to max out long before this does.  There is a little distortion when it’s cranked all the way up, but not at all what you’d expect from these little speakers pushed betond their sweet spot.For 1/4 of $100, this little guy is amazing so far.

Cure: purchased a Bluetooth transmitter for my SONY TV and used my Bluetooth earbuds. Problem ... had to take earbuds out to talk and wife couldn't hear. Purchased this speaker as a substitute. It's next to us and voice from streamed media is much clearer, especially when competing with loud background music (eg. Star Trek Discovery) or low spoken dialog (eg. Handmaiden's Tale).

As far as the tight squeeze holds it in place, it is well balanced right there and makes holding the tablet and typing and listening to music though it a breeze.  If you have a Note 12.2 or a tab 12.2 you owe it to yourself to pair this speaker with that case. Literally wished I could bend the ears of just one designer at Cambridge and get them to build perfectly match ed speakers to attach to a variety of tablets where they just snapped on as easily as this inserts in the kickstand and holds in place.Absolutely better than the JBLflip , the JawboneJambox, and countless others I've lost thoughout the years. Who could have thought a better sounding,  better designed,  and better performing battery would also be one of the lesser expensive ones. Not to mention,  with it inserted in the case above the kick stand, far less chances of walking off without it!Next up,  with this one rocking like it does in a great small form,I have got to have the larger version to sit around the house and really blast out the neighborhood!i-Blason Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 Case / Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 Case - Armorbox Dual Layer Hybrid Full-body Protective Cover with Kickstand and Impact Resistant Bumpers (Black/Black)

4.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker arrived on the first day of April in 2018. Product died in early March 2019. The company was willing to send me a replacement for the cost of shipping. I was miffed that this thing only has a year-long lifespan, because it seems wasteful that it becomes trash within a year. When I think about it, though, a $24 speaker that lasts a year is only $2/month. But their customer service was good, they responded quickly, and the replacement arrived quickly.The battery life is great at first, but within about nine months, it would only play about 3 hours on a full charge.Features I wish this thing had? A skip feature, so you could skip to the next song. A mute feature, since the ""pause"" button doesn't work with streaming video. Louder volume.I would say that the sound quality is okay - it's hard to hear quiet podcasts over the sound of my shower, even on the highest volume. If you need a speaker loud enough to blast at a party, this isn't the speaker for you. But if you just want to listen to music in your quiet house, and you're on a budget, this is a totally acceptable speaker.I probably wouldn't buy this speaker again. It is aesthetically pleasing, but light on features. The case is physically durable, but the components will not last.

It was AMAZING at first, worked well, and the battery life was great. About 4 months in it stopped syncing with my Bluetooth. I would follow all the steps in the instructions, get it resynced, and after a song or two it would un-sync again. I've gone through the process a couple times hoping it would work THIS time. It did not. Basically I spent $25 for 4 months of use, which is disappointing.

My intent was to indicate the product is unacceptable despite my having given the product 5 stars for each of Amazon's 3 pre-determined  performance ratings.I initially purchased a device 12/2018. It failed a month or so later. The company immediately sent out a replacement. Now, after a similar time frame, the device has failed again. It has failed in the precise way as the first. Despite having a great sound, good battery time, good design...the company managed to spec crap when it came to the speaker's USB port. The connection between the male charging cord and female charging port is what has failed each time and in the precise same manner.I did not bother filing a warranty claim with the company since I'd just get another speaker that would fail in a month or two. I cannot emphasize how unfortunate the company's manufacturing decisions are regarding the USB connection. The speaker is excellent. If the company spent maybe two and a half cents more per speaker for a better USB mechanical connection, the product would indeed be as good as they stipulate vs. (currently) a waste of one's money.

I have tested the range between my iPhone & this speaker and it is great.  I have been upstairs at the other end of the house with the speaker in the basement and it continues to stay connected.  The only possible future concern I have is with the power connection port.  It is currently very tight & I worry that over time it could fail.  I will update if any issues occur in the future.

I literally just received the package half an hour ago and I have been playing songs and enjoying the powerful voice and quality.  Then I am surprised by the fact that it includes a microphone.  Well, let me tell you that I originally bought this because I recently purchased an iphone case that is waterproof.  Sounds good, right?  Yes, but what I did not realize is that the sound would also muffle the speaker and microphone because the case is sealed tight to prevent water damage.  Now that I have this beautiful speaker with microphone, I plan on using it as a speaker so I can understand people better and they can understand me better.  This little gadget has a powerful impact and now I can use it for 3 different purposes.  Life does not get sweeter than this.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this speaker first for the price and ratings. It helped prove that having a bluetooth speaker next to my chair in the living room made a huge improvement in my television viewing (as my audiologist had suggested). There was some latency though of about a half-second, so I did some homework about bluetooth transmitters, speakers and latency. First step was to swap out the transmitter connected to the television; it had aptX but hung behind the television with a short cord. Then I purchased the Shenen bluetooth 4.2 speaker and the Deripus bluetooth 4.2 speaker. Never got any sound from the Deripus other than the speaker telling me it was paired. The Shenen crackled so often with intermittent communications in the first hour that it was obviously not a long term solution (even for the night). So I hooked up the Cambridge OontZ. It paired easily, and the lag with the new transmitter is barely noticeable but acceptable. Very happy with the volume controls  (lowest volume on Shenen was way too loud for me and the rest of the family), and it has the bass I need (also missing from the Shenen).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"With Cambridge SoundWorks you are always guaranteed excellent quality.  I have been using their products for decades and still have a big pair of home theater speakers that are running strong after 15 years.  This very little guy of a speaker is very impressive.  It is so tiny and obviously very easy to carry anywhere.  Of all the bluetooth speakers I have tried this was the most portable.  The ease of the bluetooth connection was a mere few seconds and it would immediately find its last source and be ready to play.  The sound quality at lower to mid levels is awesome with crystal clear clarity added with just the right amount of bass.  For me the sound did get somewhat muddled at the higher volumes.  The speaker is indeed loud but I found the clarity slightly sacrificed.  I play my speakers on the higher end in my apartment and have found others to provide better sound quality with the highs.  I am not sure if outside the highs may indeed work much better with this speaker.The biggest plus here with this speaker is ease of connection and its quality in that it is solidly built and durable while holding a constant connection.  It never breaks up in the slightest.  I also think when it comes to sound quality it is honestly a matter of preference.  Everyone plays different types and styles of music, wants different highlights in their music.  Some want more bass while some want an enhancement of vocals or treble.  This speaker is an amazing value with impressive built quality.  I can highly recommend it.

Its small size makes traveling with it easy. It doubles as a speakerphone, and I might add it's the best speakerphone I've used. The bluetooth range is great. When using as a speakerphone, I can leave my phone in my office and carry the speaker anywhere in the house with no interference or disruption. It's water resistant, so it is great to use in the shower. The controls are well placed and give you the ability to pause, skip, and of course adjust the volume. When switching between devices, you don't have to use the device it's currently connected to in order to disconnect. Just press the bluetooth button to disconnect and then connect on your other device. Even outdoors, it has powerful sound. Excellent product.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface this review by saying, I was provided a free sample for testing and review. I explained to the manufacturer that I would provide an honest review of this product. All experiences with this product and all opinions are solely my own.I purchased the prior generation of this speaker, the OontZ Angle Plus, so I'll be able to compare them. The Plus has crystal clear sound and good bass. I really enjoyed the Plus, but where the Plus needed some improvement was with its volume and bass.The new OontZ Angle3 significantly increases the volume and bass, but more importantly it retains and improves upon the crisp and crystal clear sound of its predecessor, plus it adds an ingenious bass design. More on that later.What's included in the package:1 - OontZ Angle3 Speaker1 - Micro USB Cable1 - 3.5mm Audio Cable1 - Quick Start GuideThe OontZ Angle3 is a great sounding Bluetooth speaker, in a small compact package. It weighs in at about 9 ounces. It is 5 1/4 inches long and about 2 1/2 inches high. It will basically fit in the palm of your hand. Please refer to the pictures I posted. It also retains the angular design of its predecessor, but now has a silicone rubber type finish on both ends of the speaker. It's still void of any sharp edges. It's a great looking speaker, with a unique design. I like this Angle3 design better than the Plus.It's significantly louder than the Plus and has nice bass, for a unit that's this small. If you enjoy music that has some bass, this unit should meet your needs and be truthful, the sound that comes out of this speaker is mind boggling to me and the size of this speaker belies that fact!The passive radiator, which produces the bass in the Angle3 and most Bluetooth speakers, is located on the bottom of the unit. If you place it bottom down, the bass effect is more pronounced. If you want a little less bass, you'll stand it on end. When it's bottom down, the bass has a nice little thump. I believe this was done by design and it's an ingenious feature.Be careful where you place the speaker bottom down, because it does want to move when playing music with bass. The speaker has pads on the bottom, but they work better on very smooth and glass surfaces.You can hear that Cambridge Soundworks spent the majority of its time improving and refining the sound of the Angle3. That focus on improving acoustics shows up big time in this tiny, but crystal clear and loud speaker.There's no distortion at max volume. The speaker has 10+ watts of peak power. It's now loud enough to fill up your backyard party with clear, great sounding music. My wife heard me playing music upstairs and she was in the garage. It's plenty loud!All my music testing was done using Spotify. Speaker was set to full volume and iOS volume was set two clicks from max, for most of my testing. I also tested both settings set to max.Bluetooth connectivity is super easy. It connects from one device to another effortlessly. I found you don't have to press a button on the speaker to pair it with a different device. I like intuitive functions and this one fits the bill. It also has a speakerphone function. You can play and pause your tracks from the device as well.The OontZ Angle3 doesn't have all the options others have. You don't get NFC support, a micro SD card slot or the ability to skip tracks using the speaker controls. There are other Bluetooth speakers that have these options, but if you value how well your music sounds over a myriad of options, this beautiful sounding speaker is for you.The Angle3 has an IPX5 certification, which makes it splash proof and dust proof. Great for the shower and other wet environments. Don't be afraid to shower with it or have it out in the rain. It can't be submerged in water with this IPX rating.Battery life is about 7 hours, at 60% volume. It will be less at higher volumes. This is definitely less than the Plus unit, which does 12-15 hours of use. You have to take into account that the battery is driving much more sound and requires that extra battery power. I personally like the trade off and all that's required is to charge the unit a bit more frequently. A battery status symbol shows up in my iOS devices.If you're like me and aren't interested in the all the above mentioned options, that you may never use and just want a beautiful sounding speaker that's main focus is perfecting and delivering crystal clear sound, than this speaker is an excellent option to consider.To me, the OontZ Angle3 has no real negatives to mention. You could quibble about having more features, but I really don't consider that a negative. I'd rather have a great sounding speaker, over more features. In my opinion, this is a great Bluetooth speaker for the price.The OontZ Angle3 is a very solid speaker, that now has outstanding volume and good bass. It retains and actually improves upon the crisp highs and strong mids of its predecessor. I like that Cambridge Soundworks is actually focusing on sound quality and not loading up on tons of features.I can highly recommend the OontZ Angle3.Thank you for reading my review.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a bit smaller than what I expected, but it's a good personal speaker for at home use. The sound quality is really good for the price point but the volume could be louder. While it's a bit too quiet to really use as a ""party"" speaker, it's perfect for use around the house, shower, or with a few friends, and it probably wont upset the neighbors. Speaking of the shower, a feature that I really enjoy is that it's water resistant. I wouldn't take it in the shower with me, but it holds up nicely against steam or counter-top spills. It also seems to have better bass than most of the smaller bluetooth speakers that I've used. The wifi range is great, I'd say it can reliably reach about 100 ft, but I've not really had the opportunity to really test it's limits. I literally use this daily lol

(In the bathroom, if I put one side up on the lip of the sink, the bass effect through the sink cabinet is deeper and fuller sounding)+ Bass is OK outdoors, but its not going to sound as rich as indoors.+ Can be used while charging.- not a whole lot of control options directly on the speakerI had a 20 year old Cambridge Sound Works PC speaker set that is no longer made that, sadly, finally stopped working. It was crystal clear and had excellent bass and while not as powerful bass as my new replacement speaker system, was definitely a richer, fuller sound rivaling my home theater.  I didn't realize/notice that the OontZ Angle 3 was also made by CSW until after i'd received it.  The brand holds up its name in quality, and at 24 bucks I was really surprised what it delivered.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"sound is great, loud, splash proof, and everything else the good reviews say are for the most part all true. But maybe I got a bad apple, so it won't get 1-star because I do believe I could be on the small percentage of casualties.I've had this speaker for about 6 months, use it about 1-4 times a month, and it's never gotten wet.One day it just quit taking/holding a charge. Plug it in and it shows charging, after a few hours of being plugged in it still wont turn on. Being out of warranty I went ahead and broke it down and starting testing the battery on my bench and determined the battery cell was just bad. Not the PCB that's wrapped up inside the skin of the battery (probably controls over charging, over heating, and whatnot) but the cell itself just up and quit.Luckily it was a 18650 size 3v battery which are available with leads and controllers already.This is the other annoying part and why it gets 2 stars. it's only the cheapest, lowest capacity 18650 around. 2000 mAh and NiMh. In today's world, why not something bigger or maybe even lithium? I would pay the extra $4 in cost difference in the end for a unit that could advertise higher quality components.So I scooped up a new cheap battery, a 4000 mAh 18650 with leads and board. Wired it up and now I've got twice the usable play time.If it would have lasted a whole year I would have probably considered it a 3-4 star unit. But 6 months of light use just doesn't cut it.

First one stopped charging after a couple years, thought it was due to a water spill that happened at about the same time.Bought this one Sep 2016.  Stopped working May 2017.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality and overall functionality of the device isn't bad. However, the build quality leaves a lot to be desired. I say this because the case of the speaker melted and warped. Yes, this really happened. The speaker, which I was using in place of my broken aux port, literally cannot withstand the direct sunlight on a hot day. The case of the speaker began melting and is now warped. There is now a noticeable difference in the quality of audio. Aditionally, the battery is maintaining far fewer hours of charge. That is of course, when it charges. Which, I'm sure, is do to the fact that the case melted and is now warped. Did I mention that the case melted and warped? That all being said, if you intend to use this in your car or next to a fire while camping (or a heat source and etc.), do not. In fact, if you aren't in the frigid indoors just save yourself the trouble and don't use it. I say this because your speaker will likely warp due to it melting.I will be adding a few photos to this review in a couple hours when the chance arises.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"*** update, had to add a star as the sound experience referred to below was based on Bluetooth and iphone 4. When connected directly with cable to different device the sound is okay ***Almost everything else about this thing is great, built well, decent feature set, price but the one thing that matters (at least to me) above all else is sound quality. It is truly poor. I have no idea how you can use the word bass in a sentence when referring to 1.5"" ""speakers"", maybe there be those folks who take this thing fishing and it bass they are thinking of not bass.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"SOUND: The sound produced blows away the competition.  Built by Cambridge Soundworks, this small speaker somehow fills up a room.  Deep bass you can feel.DESIGN & OPERATION: Straight forward operation.  Sync was easy and no problems.  There are somewhat sticky rubber feet at the base that keep it from sliding or rattling on a hard surface.  Extremely durable and resistant of the elements including sand.  Design and overall build quality is solid.CHARGING & BATETERY: Battery lasts a couple hours at full volume, which is usually plenty if you remember to have it charged.  Charges using a ubiquitous Micro-USB jack.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this speaker.  I've had it for about three months and have used it several times before writing this.  I love music and really want a quality Bluetooth speaker with a well-rounded sound.  This OontZ delivers.  It has a great sound with a nice low end.  Of course, it doesn't have a deep end like a separate subwoofer, but you can hear the bass notes really well.  I play bass guitar and want to hear the low end.  This speaker delivers really well.  The controls are easy to use and I have had no problems connecting to my iPhone or iPad.  The battery life is great as well.  It will last all day long.This speaker really shines when it is set on a flat, solid surface as the bass comes from the bottom.  It loses the low end if it is carried in your hand or just tossed on a bed or placed outside on the grass.  If it is placed on any solid surface the speaker produces a fantastic tone.  I own a DOSS Touch Bluetooth speaker and a Bose Soundlink Bluetooth speaker.  The Oontz outperforms the DOSS hands down based off of controls, sound (when placed on a flat surface) and simplicity of use.  The DOSS does sound great and is not dependent on placement nearly as much as the Oontz, but I prefer the Oontz.  The Bose does sound better than this Oontz with similar controls but not by much.  And the price of the Oontz is much better.  If money were no problem and sound quality was the top priority, I would pick the Bose over this speaker.  But considering you could purchase at least four of these Oontz speakers for the price of one Bose, the Oontz wins hands down. It sounds great, has a long battery life, connects easily and does NOT have an annoying series of beeps like the DOSS when connecting to your phone.

Have they broken up? seriously, I've tried everything, all the trouble shooting tips and nothing works, just endless blinking blue light and Alexa giving up finally. Bummed, cuz I was lovin on this little speaker....****UPDATE****Cambridge Soundworks called me to help reset the thing after a recent Amazon dot update...Go into your settings on the alexa app, delete the app, unplug the Dot, wait.......power back up, go into app settings, find new device, and re-connect.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I couldn't really tell you how well this product functions because, unlike the new product I thought I ordered, I was sent a ""speaker"" that was apparently well used. It had accumulated the kind of gunk in the speaker grill that takes at least months if not years to collect, as well as a tremendous amount of scratches around the charging port. Someone connected this and disconnected this quite a few times. Worst of all, it can't be charged.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the older OontZ Ultra-Portable Wireless speaker. This unit is a replacement. It's a great speaker, with many of the Oontz features, but updated for better performance. The sound quality is better than my previous Oontz with more bass and richer highs and midrange. I use this as a bedroom speaker for relaxation and sleeping sound tracks like ocean and forest sounds. The volume is great and has plenty of range and power for the room. The sound quality doesn't suffer at higher volumes. I listen to ambient sounds as I mentioned above as well as acoustic guitar and blue grass. I've been pleased with the sound quality for that type of music. I've used the speaker outside on my deck at a picnic table and it had plenty of power to fill the area. Many people describe sound quality from these type of speakers as ""tinny"" or weak, however this speaker is not like that. A great feature of the speaker is the hands free calling feature. This works seamlessly when the speaker is paired with my phone (iPhone 6+) and I'm pleased with the call sound and the microphone. The company claims this speaker is redesigned to be more powerful and have deeper bass. I agree with that claim, however my expectations are aligned with a speaker of this type and size. You should not be expecting sound like you would get from larger stereo speakers. My recommendation for the BEST performance and sound quality is to also download a high quality Equalizer App for your iPhone and use it when playing your music. The app I use is called ""Equalizer"" from Audioforge. My previous Oontz was difficult to pair, but pairing this speaker is quick and easy. The annoying blue light that was located on the front of the older Oontz has been relocated to the side panel of this speaker. My experience with battery life is about 7 -12 hours between charges. However, I would like a longer charging cord. The included USB cord is quite short (6 inches) and has to located directly near the power source. The speaker does not come with a wall charger. A 3.5 mm, 32 inch audio cable is included.  This speaker is designed to be water proof and as such the controls are on the sealed, silicone end panel and have raised ridges to help you locate them. The charging port and 3.5 mm jack port are located on the back panel of the speaker under a tight, silicone flap that's just a bit tricky to open. The sealed power button is directly above the ports. The front panel is a typical metal, perforated grill. The bass radiators are on the bottom panel along with nonskid silicone feet. Overall, I enjoy this speaker, I am pleased with its performance, the sale price was low compared to the quality and features and Cambridge is a known, established, American company. I've contacted Cambridge customer service and received prompt and expert service. The Cambridge website has plenty of resources and information as well. If you need a quality, portable speaker with great performance, give this one a try.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"For what you pay and how compact this awesome little speaker is, the sound and value are amazing.I bought this to replace my portable iHome speakers that finally bit the dust. It's worth noting that those died in part because of on/off switches that would often accidentally slip on in luggage, ruining the battery; they also had rather cumbersome wires.These address those issues and more, including adding a number of great little touches:-Rubberized buttons that are water resistant-The speaker automatically shuts off if no sound is coming through them to preserve battery--unless it's already plugged in; great design feature!-Great battery life, partly because of the above point, and partly because it's just a high quality, high capacity battery-Did I mention that the sound is amazing for its size and price?! Brought this to my friend's bachelor party in Mexico and it was plenty loud for the big house we rented out. No, the speaker is not a Bose 7.1 Dolby Surround home theater set up, but it shouldn't be. It's only about 5 inches wide and costs the same as a trip to the convenience store.-Bluetooth reduces the need for cords, but also works with a standard headphone jack (and comes with the cord!), which you can use to plug into a computer, for exampleAltogether it's one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered the OontZ Angle 3 in August, 2018, and connected it in October, 2018.  It worked great, and has a clear sound for what I was using it for (podcasts and audiobooks).  The problem is that I can't get the micro-USB cord to stay in the charging port, it seems to have a bent connection pin.  I don't know if it's my fault, since it is recessed, and shouldn't need any special things to plug it in (I've had other micro-USB connectors that are still working well after 5 years), but I can't charge it any more.Because I like the size and the sound when it did work, I did purchase another one.  I'm bummed that the warranty is only 90 days.  I hope the replacement unit lasts a lot longer than 5  months, if not, this will be the last Cambridge Soundworks bluetooth speaker I buy.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Back about 2005-2010 when mini Bluetooth speakers used to be the new toy everyone wanted (and you paid the price to be an early adopter) I was really into the fad and couldn’t stop looking for the perfect one. As a result I ended up with more of them than most dealers, speakers of every possible shape and gimmick. Some of them were knock your socks off impressive, including some so small I could stuff them in my carry on when I traveled so I could have music in my hotel rooms.These days there are a handful left from the major brands. One of them I was curious about was this series from Cambridge SoundWorks, a company I’ve known and respected since I worked directly with their founder Henry Kloss back in the late 80’s and early 90’s. Unlike the early days of Bluetooth mini speakers this little speaker was only nineteen bucks, probably the lowest I’ve ever paid for any speaker. I had mixed expectations. But I chose it both for its size and its shape, I was looking for a small personal speaker to put on the base of my desktop monitor to be able to listen to content at low volume without using my high-end Boston Acoustics system.The small size is truly impressive as is the surprisingly nice look and feel of the speaker. It is heavier than similar no name speakers and you almost have to wonder how they can sell it for such a low price. It comes with a micro USB charging cable and also a mini audio cable. The power switch is easily reached near the top of the back of the speaker where the audio input and charging port are also located behind a rubber flap. The rest of the controls are on the right side of the wedge.The speaker will pair easily with newer Bluetooth devices but it seems it is not 100% compatible with all of the many standards. For example it would not pair with my desktop computer without downloading an updated Bluetooth driver.The most important thing you probably want to know is how does it sound. I’m sorry to say that with almost 20,000 review written already, many of them high energy endorsements, I’m not as impressed. I have definitely heard better from similar sized, and even smaller, speakers. It’s not bad, but it’s not knock your socks off impressive. And it’s definitely not a speaker that you would choose if there were more than one or two listeners or for use outdoors.There are a couple of things to be aware of that I liked – one is that if you use the audio cable the speaker won’t shut off automatically after a few minutes like many other brands do, but it will shut off after 15 minutes of non-playing when used in the Bluetooth mode.  Interestingly, if you pair it with an Echo device the power stays on all the time in battery mode so you would probably want to keep it plugged in to a power source if that’s your plan.I also like that you only hear the pairing sound once the first time unlike many other brands that make a loud sound whenever they are powered on or when pairing is successful. For me that is a deal breaker.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why some might think it has crappy sound, and how to fix it (Not an issue with the speaker!)...The speaker has two modes... phone calls or music. If the device you are connecting to uses its ""Mic"", it will use the ""Hands Free"" Bluetooth mode. The quality of the ""Hands Free"" Bluetooth mode is sub-par. Good for phone calls, sucky for music. If the device you connect it to recognizes it as an audio device, the audio quality is WAY better, I mean night and day, but has no Mic functionality. I use it as an audio device, and I do not use its Mic functionality. If you use it with a computer, you may have to disable the hands free functionality in the Control panel > Sound (See images) to get good audio from it and to use it as a speaker. So basically it depends how the device you connect it to handles it. My Pixel 2 sees it as an audio device, and I get great quality when listening to music, then it switches over to ""Hands Free"" mode and it sounds like any other hands free Bluetooth speaker...I don't ever leave reviews hardly, but this guy is worth it. For a speaker of it's size it is GREAT. Honestly I have been extremely impressed with its performance, it really sounds rich. It has a full range sound. It is not going to have tons of bass (No small speaker does because of physical characteristics) but if you are looking for a well blended sound this guys is perfect! For its size it has a fair amount of base (As much as a small speaker can). Its mids, highs, and lows, all complement and one does not dominate the other. In addition I am 1/2 deaf, and this thing can crank. Don't get me wrong it is still a small speaker, so you aren't going to get surround sound quality, but it goes loud enough that it might even be considered uncomfortably loud (To a 1/2 deaf person).I use it as a computer speaker at night, because I can place it next to my bed so I can watch movies as I fall asleep and not bother people in the other rooms, and don't have to worry about wearing headphones.It has fairly big volume adjustments on its side, so it is easy to adjust the volume or turn the volume down in the middle of the night. I use a 4.2 pluggable USB adapter on the computer, and I am able to go into other rooms close to the computer. But it will cut out any further than that. It does sometimes struggle in rooms next to the computer, but usually you can find a spot where it works just fine.I can actually carry it into the bathroom (Very close by, only one room over) and listen to audio on my computer while I take a shower... BUT it is not going to give you any significant left/right channel, it comes out more of a mono speaker.It will cut out if you get too far away from the computer, so it def won't go through the whole house, but into a room over it should do decent. (With that USB Bluetooth 4.2 Pluggable adapter).

4.0 out of 5 stars,"When I first went to make a review, I was kinda irate because the speaker didn't appear to be recognized by my Echo Dot. The pamphlet included with the speaker is woefully out of date with how to connect a bluetooth speaker to Echo Dot. That said, eventually I figured it out. The speaker's sound fidelity is about average and what you would expect for a ~$25 traveling bluetooth speaker. It decently fills up my living room or home gym with decent enough quality audio -- and it's battery life is pretty good.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, usually I do better buying things from Amazon. I really should have checked the size, it is pretty small. I am not sure how other reviewers can say it has great sound. I found it sounding ""tinny"", not much in the base department. It is loud but can get then distortion. Otherwise, It was easy to set up and works properly. Since returning it at this price point is a bother, I will keep it and find some use for it, but I will likely buy a better one. Added Note 5/31/18: article in Washington Post some weeks ago suggests bluetooth speakers have been a significant target of fraudulent reviews which I think explains clearly why the reviews are grossly inflated. Buyer beware.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The alternator recently died in my Saturn Vue and took the factory standard stereo with it (which was already a bit wonky). I tried changing the fuses and my mechanic made sure it wasn't something he unintentionally caused and could correct when he was taking care of the alternator, all to no avail. And after the alternator, an A/C repair a couple of months ago, and work done on the fuel system a couple of months prior to that I'm not exactly in a place to replace the stereo, so I've been trying to get by the last couple of weeks with just my headset or one of the other Bluetooth speakers we have, including our beloved VicTsing. Unfortunately, the volume just could not compete with road noise intrusion and the bass was blown out and static-y.  That and I prefer to have my caterwauling masked by loud music and bass, so it's been a sad couple of weeks of commuting unless I stuck to podcasts and even then I couldn't really hear lower register sounds over the road noise.This little gem arrived yesterday and I was immediately blown away by just how loud it could get in a 10x15 room, let alone a vehicle cabin! The sound is clear and the bass is deep and not distorted, even at top volume. It has super grippy little feet on the bottom that kept it solidly on my dashboard for my entire commute, even going around corners and making turns! And while it's not exactly the same as having the surround of multiple speakers, front and back, it totally works as I need it to.  The sound fills the cabin and for the most part, it's akin to having my stereo back in working order. Thank you to Oontz for providing an inexpensive solution!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker was purchased over others because there was an Amazon recommendation next to it.  It just does not really sound good.  I have tried it in multiple settings, such as in the car, on office desk, hooked up to Amazon Dot in the kitchen.  It is OK for music and terrible for spoken word.  For music it boosts the sound volume of my other devices and adds base.  The trouble is the mid range of the speaker.  If you listen to any talk radio or books, do not buy this speaker.  It makes the voice of the speaker sound like he is singing/speaking on the chipmunks album.  I have never heard anything like it.  I tried downloading some equalizer apps, but that did not work either.  It is actually very bad to listen to this speaker and now I guess I will have to gift it to someone or just let it sit collecting dust, because I cannot stand to listen to it.  I am now also jaded to Amazon's choice or Amazon's pick or whatever they call it.  It is obviously just a brazen sales ploy instead of an actual recommendation like consumer reports or other rating sites.  I suspect from my experience with this speaker that they just recommended it to get rid of the stock.  I waffled between two stars 'I don't like it' and one star 'I hate it'.  I hate it.  One star. I have to make an addendum to this review. Since I was not able to figure out how to return this item, I have used it subsequently in a very limited fashion. The chipmunk sound that I described has not recurred, so I suspect and Internet or provider error. The sound quality is not great, but this is a very small speaker.  I am not thrilled with the sound but I’m also not extremely unhappy with the device as I was previously. Rating has been changed from one star to three stars

I charged it fully before use as recommended, i gave it a full six hour charge. As soon as it was charged i easily connected it via Blue Tooth to my Android Smart Phone and it connected on the first try with no problems at all.  This turned out to be the loudest most crystal clear Blue Tooth Speaker i have ever owned, I turned it on so i could jam to my oldies while i cleaned the house. I sat it next to the kitchen sink and i could easily hear it at the other end of my 2,600 square foot home while i scrubbed floors.  It is light weight and not a hassle to carry at all. It would easily fit in my wife's handbag.  I am going to purchase a second one to keep in the car for our picnics at the park or for when we go rafting down the river.

Packaging is a nonissue) I immediately blasted the volume and threw on some tunes. I was disappointed with the speaker even with the crazy low price (mid $20s). It was tinny. I dont have a bunch of fancy audiophile terminology to throw your way to convince you I know what I'm talking about, but I do listen to music for most of my waking hours and I know what sounds good and what frankly sounds like crap. It sounded like crap,Ive used it quite a bit since then and am much happier with the purchase. At low to mid volumes this thing really shines. It is still a cheap, portable bluetooth speaker; you can't even compare the sound to a decent stereo system. For what it is, though, it is a great little speaker. It is much smaller than I expected, is loud, is light, and seems to be living up to the waterproof claims, although I have not submerged it fully.I was disappointed to find that there is no way to attach a caribeener to this, as far as I can tell.I am happy with my choice and purchase.If you are looking for a similarly priced speaker to use in a dry, stable environment I like the DOSS Soundbox's sound a bit more.Neither of those will really compare to a decent sound system, of course, but for $20-$40 you can't expect much.

Normally, I sort these things out and avoid the minefields of dubious products that promise big, but deliver small.Yes, this is a Bluetooth speaker, and yes, it does pair up and play music from your device, but to claim that the sound quality is anywhere near ""good"" is stretching things. There are some Bluetooth​ speakers that make you wonder just how someone managed to make so much sound come out of such a small device. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those. It sounds ""okay,"" but there is nothing about it that is going to amaze you in ANY way. Yes, it plays music, but don't expect it to amaze you in any way.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did a lot of research before choosing this speaker. I was impressed by the large number of 5 star buyer ratings. The price was excellent as well. Speaker came packaged perfectly. Included was a 3 foot Micro-USB charging cable and 3 foot 3.5mm audio cable; I wish these were longer but that is just my personal preference. Speaker came partially charged. Instructions states it can be used while charging. Speaker pairs easily and quickly, but I did experience problems getting it to disconnect from one device to pair to a different source. I contacted the company and they were quick to respond back to me. Their customer service was excellent, fast, relevant and courteous. They even offered to call me to assure that the device was working properly or not. After working with it a few days the device started working as expected and has not had an issue ever since. Maybe it was user error? Not sure. I also ordered the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS. The Angle 3 PLUS offers 30 hours of playtime vs the Angle 3 which only offers 7 hours (a big difference). The Angle 3 PLUS is a tad taller at 6 1/2"". The Angle 3 is 5 1/4"", see attached photos. I didn't notice a sound quality difference but my musician son did. He ordered the 3 PLUS and says it is a better speaker than his Jawbone Bluetooth Speaker for less than half the cost. I use the smaller speaker, which sets on a high shelf in my shower, as it is water resistant & splash proof. The other sets on my office desk. If you are considering purchasing a Bluetooth speaker definitely consider the OontZ. I would go for the Angle 3 PLUS as the price difference is only about $7 unless a smaller speaker is your goal. I have referred several people to this powerful little speaker and all are very happy with their purchase.

I can even take it to the downstairs kitchen and it works great.  The sound that comes from this little speaker is exceptional.  It is a very full, rich sound.  While my Echo has great sound, I actually like the sound from this better.  You are also able to use the volume up/down buttons to go back or forward to the next song.  It has a pause button, also.  The charge lasts a very long time.  I bought this in June.  I use it from 2 - 6 hours a day and I have only recharged it once, but, only to keep it at full charge in case the electricity went out.  How wonderful it is to have a cordless speaker that is this great.  Makes storm power outages much more pleasant!  Power was out for 10 hours, went back out for 6 hours, and, without a charge, it worked perfectly for those 16 hours.  I absolutely love the non-skid rubber on the bottom.  Between my kitties and me, things are always getting knocked around. This speaker doesn't move!  It doesn't even slide easy!  In the kitchen, the OontZ 3 got splashed quite a bit.  The water stayed on the covering and wiped off easy.  Fixing to buy a second one for my roommate!  I LOVE IT!!!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this for my parents (older) so they can play music/YouTube videos from their iPad. I showed them how to use it (very simple to operate) and it will work perfectly for them in that sense. The size and the sound quality is good to.My biggest problem with this Bluetooth speaker is that it’s pure solid black (including all the buttons). The black buttons are very difficult to see because they blend in with the color of the device. You can’t see them unless you hold this device at a particular angle and under a bright light. What genius at the manufacture thought of this design? Stupid design. A younger person must have thought of it.The manufacturer could have easily made the buttons a different color (other than black) so that they can be seen easily. I had to put drops of white paint on top of the buttons so they can easily be seen now. I shouldn’t need to have done that. The manufacture should have designed it that way! How hard would that have been. Pathetic.If you are older, do not buy this. Choose another brand and just know that most of these tech companies these days design things for younger people and don’t give a crap about older people’s needs. Good luck.

I would love to order a replacement but I'm not sure if I have confidence in this item.  Seen other reviews also saying that unit stops charging.  Do not buy this item!This is a great speaker, hands down.  Lightweight, unbelievable sound for its size and price.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second Oontz I bought (the first one being the Oontz plus, the older and bigger version). This speaker worked well initially, although I found the sound is not as crisp as the bigger version. About one month later, the plastic strip that covers the power button and USB port fell off. It made it looks kind of ugly. Aside from that, it made powering on/off the speaker very annoying because it relies you to press the plastic strip to power on/off it. Without the plastic strip, you have to use a small pin to push the little button inside a hole to turn on/off it.Worse thing, now the speaker's battery is completely dead. No matter how long you charge it through USB port, it does not have any power. Essentially, it is a dead speaker. I kind of noticed that the speaker's play time lasted shorter and shorter. But I did not really pay attention as I though I did not charge long enough. Now it is completely dead and useless.It is a very bad experience with this speaker and I would not recommend buying it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a small blue tooth speaker because the Echo Dot sound quality just wasn't cutting it and i would like to add music to whatever room I am working in that may not have a device. I have an Echo Dot 2nd and 3rd gen. The 2nd gen is tinny and the 3rd way too bass centric and boomy, but still better than this speaker. The sound quality doesn't blow me away, in fact, it is pretty bad. Not enough bass and not much of an improvement over my Echo Dot Mini 2nd Gen. Wow, this is so disappointing. The speaker paired easily with my phone and laptop, but had an issue pairing with the Alexa app via blue tooth. The controls are a pain to see in low light. As long as you keep your expectations super low you will be happy.----Update-----Lost another star after buying the Doss Touch speaker for $4 more. The Doss has MUCH better sound quality and paired to Echo Dot instantly. The Oontz seems to be having difficulties with Alexa. Probably going to return this and buy the upgraded version of the Doss 20W because I am much more impressed with that speaker as a whole. The sound quality on the Doss is more balanced and it has True Wireless Stereo so both can be used simultaneously. At first it was about being an upgrade to the Echo Dot sound quality, but now it's about better sound with every device. I was never happy with the sound on the Oontz to begin with and now it's completely unacceptable after trying a much better speaker within the same price range.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery in my ancient Bose Soundlink Mini II will no longer hold a charge so it was time to buy a really expensive new battery or just replace the speaker.  I bought the Oontz Angle 3 because of the ""rich bass"" and ""crystal clear stereo sound"" hype, the overwhelming number of excellent reviews, the small footprint and the crazy low price.The Angle 3 arrived fully charged so I plugged it into a music source (my desktop computer) and fired up some tunes.  ""Rich bass?""  Puhleez.  The sound was harsh, tinny and decidedly bass-free.  And if there was any ""crystal clear stereo"" separation going on it completely escaped me.  I actually grabbed the instructions to find out if I needed to enable something, download the latest drivers, anything...this couldn't be the same product.In retrospect I guess I wanted something for next to nothing and I got what I paid for.  This Oontz will get loud and presumably run off battery for a long time, as well as hold a BlueTooth connection over a long distance.  And the price is hard to beat.  If that's what you're shopping for this may work for you.  I don't care about any of that; I want a very compact speaker system replacement for my desktop PC that packs a punch.  This is not that item.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took this on vacation with a big group of friends and it got a ton of use.  It went to the beach with us, it was out on the deck, etc. constantly.  I used it myself, let my friends connect to it and so on.Connection - easy.  Paired it to probably 5 different phones over the course of the week and nobody had any trouble hooking up to it, and it seemed to keep a solid connection even when there was a good distance between the phone and the speaker.  There is no security code and it shows up as Oontz Angle on your phone so it is obvious what it is.  It gives a chime to tell you it has successfully paired, so it is very easy to manage.  It will automatically pair to the last device connected to it if it finds it in range when you turn it on.Battery life - if you remember to charge it at the end of the day, it does not die.  Even with heavy use, we never had it die on us during the day.Sound Quality - It can get shockingly loud without distortion for such a little speaker.  Loud enough to fill even a big room.  Probably the best way to describe the sound quality is that it is appropriate for the intended use - out at the beach, on the deck, on a picnic, etc.  This thing isn't going to replace your home stereo, or even compete with much larger speaker systems that aren't meant to be portable or go outside.  But it more than gets by.  I tend to be fairly fussy about sound quality and yet I really didn't mind listening to this little thing for hours.  Yes, you cannot really fight physics when it comes to bass, it doesn't have separate tweeters, etc. but despite all that, the sound is still somehow not objectionable.  It is not going to blow you away with how great it sounds, but given how little it costs, how small it is, and the fact that it is waterproof, it is definitely punching a few notches above its weight.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace a more expensive speaker which I use at work.  Having left the other one (JBL Flip 2) there it was eventually blown out by someone else, so I wanted to bring in something cheaper so I wouldn't care when it ends up getting ruined by inconsiderate people.The speaker is very light compared to the Flip 2.  The triangle design is much better in terms of preventing the unit from rolling off of whatever surface it's on.  It is overall not as wide as I imagined it would be.  It feels a little cheap but produces pretty good sound at a pretty good volume.  I find it a bit amusing that they would single out ""more bass"" right in the title of the item listing because that's the biggest difference I have heard so far between this and the Flip 2; the OontZ Angle does a passable job on bass heavy audio but it's nowhere near what you would get with something of higher quality like the Flip or a Bose Mini.Some of the design choices are a bit cheap feeling as well.  The indicator that the unit is charging is a slowly blinking red light.  The indicator that the unit is fully charged is that the light no longer blinks.  Good one, save the consumer a couple of dollars by just using the one LED.  You can't see this light from the front of the unit and it's not easy to see in general under 'normal' indoor lighting conditions unless you're looking right at it from a short distance.  The power button is also a source of small frustration -- I haven't figured out yet if I really need to press it two or three times to turn the unit off by design or if I'm just not pressing it hard enough or long enough.All the above negative criticism aside this is a fine product for the price.  I would say that if you've had or heard more expensive units from more established speaker brands, don't expect the sound quality of this to truly compare to them regardless of what the other reviews say.  This may be the best sound you'll get for under $30, I don't know for sure, but don't think you're cheating the system if you buy this -- if you're really into high quality spend some more money.Based on a couple of days of use in a few different situations I would buy this again.  I'd buy another one to leave up at the family cabin.  I'd consider it an easy gift purchase for a friend.  Being that it's so inexpensive I would consider it easily replaceable and not really mind if it got damaged or broken, however sad of a statement that is.Update: I DID end up buying another one of these recently to have around the house, again because it's just so good for the price.  I'm happy to say that the physical design issues I mentioned in my first review have been improved in a slight redesign.  The tactile response of the physical buttons is greatly improved.  The positioning of the status LEDs has also been improved.  I can't be positive but it feels like the sound is a little cleaner from the new unit, especially spoken word.  I'm completely happy with this now, I have nothing to nitpick.  Because of these improvements I happily updated my review from four to five stars.  You can't go wrong with this product.

You get what you pay for and this is no exception. This sounds like the speakers that come with those old-school alarm clocks. I literally laughed out when I played it and I am no way near being an audiophile.  I don’t know who wrote all those positive reviews but either people have low expectations or something very odd is going on because this is laughable.  Also, there was some weird rattling noise.

I was looking at devices that cost almost $200.00 and at the last minute changed my mind after I spoke with a friend who recommended I get a Bluetooth compatible device. So I went on Amazon and began looking for such a product when I saw OontZ Angle 3 product with, get this, 35,000 reviews.........that's not a typo...35,000 reviews. OK that was amazing but then I saw the price $25.99. I thought that MUST be a mistake! I also thought how good could this product be for $25.99 but I also thought if that many people liked this item then I should order it and see.

The sound is wonderful with a lovely bass, I can be up to 100 feet and still have a Bluetooth connection, it is so simple to use has twin speakers and is less than 6 inches long. Cambridge Products has hit a grand slam with this product and its price point. Go out and buy it...................its that good.

I am grateful for their outstanding customer service and gladly changed this review to 5 stars.- - - - - - - - - -Let's get this out of the way right from the start. The reason for the one star review is because eight days after the return period expired (38 days after purchase) the speaker will no longer charge. The mini-usb connector on the unit is of poor quality and deformed easily rendering the speaker useless. See picture.When it worked, it was fantastic and I bought a second one for my girlfriend. The sound is great for a unit this size and the bass is remarkable. It even jumped off a table a few times because the bass was making the whole thing bounce. In summary, I was thrilled with this purchase up to the minute it bricked itself. I'm not crazy about the 30 day return window when the merchandise is defective. 😡

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My trusty little CA speaker (non Bluetooth) had just died after 11 years of faithful service, so I was on the hunt for a replacement.  I searched Amazon extensively and decided on the OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen) because of the price and reviews.  Had I continued searching within the OontZ line of products, I would have purchased the slightly more expensive (and a bit larger) model with the ability to switch tracks from the speaker and the extended battery life.  But, I bought the OontZ Angle 3.  My first impression when it arrived was that it was way smaller than expected, but that's a good thing.  I use the unit with a 3mm headphone jack cable attached to my iPod, so I'm already way lower tech than the folks who will use this as a Bluetooth speaker.  I use this speaker on my motorcycle rides - not on the bike itself, but in the tent or motel when I land.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The bass could be a little deeper, but overall it sounds great and gets loud.  My minor complaint(s) with the unit are as follows:  1) it's all black  (by the way this comes in several colors, which I didn't realize when I ordered)  Because it's all black, the controls are hard to see  2) the little rubbery flap that lifts up (near the on/off button)  which contains the charging port and headphone jack - looks like it will tear off if not handled VERY carefully.  I play mine standing on end in order to get the most bass quality, otherwise the bass speaker is facing downward and the sound is somewhat muffled.  If I had it to do over, I would buy the larger OontZ Angle and buy it in a color other than black.  Otherwise, I love the speaker.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Charging this thing is annoying. The light stays red the entire time you're charging and it gives no indication that it is done charging. I can leave it on the charger for a full day and the light will just stay pulsing red. So I never know when it is actually done charging, or how long it actually takes to fully charge because there is not indicator.Battery life is pretty poor for a bluetooth speaker. This thing is a little over a year old and it gets around 8 hours of play before the battery dies.. It also doesn't give a warning that the battery is getting low, it just dies. By comparison, my cheap $20 anker BT headphones get nearly the same battery life. Also, my old Photive Hyrda speaker that I had for 3 years maintained it's battery life very well and would consistently get 18 hours of battery life even though it was rated to only get up to 8 hours.Maybe mine is a dud, because of all the good reviews. But the battery is definitely very poor. Also, I play music with the volume at around 50-70% so the battery life should be at least as good, or even better than they advertise. (Since they rate their battery life using the device at 2/3 volume (66%))As far as the waterproofing, it's very good. I use it in the shower all the time and have taken it kayaking and to the beach. Never had an issue with that. The sound is very good for it's size too.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker is better than what our 48 inch TV can put out. I read the reviews and saw how many people were happy with it but I wasn't expecting it to be so crisp. The volume goes louder than I would ever play it in my home but I can see this being amazing in a crowded loud room. Let alone a shower.The bass is perfect, it's just a really good little speaker. I have a feeling well be getting a lot of use out of it. We've had other speakers before but they end up collecting dust because they were cheap and the sound quality was the same as a smart phone. I mean, the cheap ones aren't even comparable to this.Bluetooth connecting was seamless. For instance, I have a Bluetooth receiver in my car even after years of using it it takes 30 seconds to pair even with a remembered device. My husband pressed the pair button on his phone and it instantly paired. Although, if you do have some trouble pairing, you can always use the auxiliary cord included.This says it takes 5-6 hours to fully charge and the charge can last up to 12 hours at 2/3 of the volume. It also says you can use it while it charges.This was really good money spent. I don't think I've ever been more impressed with something for the price. If you had shown me this and I didn't know the price I would say it's worth 50$ which I wouldn't spend on a speaker. I'm so happy with this I'm gonna be buying more as gifts for Christmas for sure.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Oontz Angle 3 is the best selling bluetooth speaker on Amazon and after trying others in the same price range, one can can see why. The sound is loud, clear and well balanced requiring no eq. On some songs the treble can be a bit forward sounding but for the most part it is stable. The bass is passable but nothing special. The sound quality of the Angle 3 is better than most of the competitors I have tried in this price range.Out-of-the-box the Angle 3 came with 30% charge enabling me to test it immediately. Battery life is reasonable, shows up in iOS and is in check with the specifications printed on manufacturer’s website.The Angle sports a triangular design with two drivers on the front configured in stereo and a passive radiator located at the bottom allowing the Angle 3 to resonate bass frequencies off the surface its placed on.The Angle 3 has two rubber pads on the bottom near both ends. I listen mostly to rock however if you play a track with excessive bass like “Billie Eilish - you should see me with a crown” at max volume the Angle 3 will move about on the table. This could have been prevented if SoundWorks installed weight strips in the Angle 3. This isn’t an issue for most music played through these but it’s still something to consider.Pairing the Angle 3 to my iPhone was simple and the connection is solid, even at great distances. The Angle 3 features a play/pause, volume controls. The volume controls are independent of iOS so you will have to set both at applicable levels.Films are a joy to watch on-the-go with the Angle 3 as audio plays back in sync with video. There is barely any noticeable latency when paired with my iPhone. Very important.Color: I love white electronics and would have appreciated SoundWorks providing the option of purchasing the Angle 3 in solid white as opposed to the black/white combination. As the option wasn’t available, I purchased the solid black version.The Angle 3 is a great little bluetooth speaker. It deliverers clear and balanced audio at an in-expensive price point. It could benefit from more bass, however considering the construction, competition and price point this is not a bad buy.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this speaker to play music during work. We stream background music in the office, low volume. This speaker's sound is somewhat tinny with very little bass at low volume.  It sounds better as you crank it up but even then doesn't provide the richness of some other portable speakers.  I've played it both bluetooth and accessory cord and both sound equivalent.  I do love its size and ease of use. It paired with both my phone and laptop flawlessly. Volume controls are simple and functional. Charging is easy and the battery life at low volume is easily 10+ hours. And, importantly, its sized to fit in my briefcase as I travel to different offices.  Still, I was hoping for a better sound quality.  I listened to another speaker, longer but narrower, that had a much richer sound and frequency response. It also cost about twice as much as this Oontz 3.Spend a little more, get a fair bit more.

Between the iPhone volume and the speaker volume the output is loud enough for my needs. I can’t comment on music quality or whether the speaker is loud enough to fill a room or be heard above a lot of ambient noise or conversation. HOWEVER:  the product listing caption says it has a range of 100ft. I sort of knew that was too good to be true but hey, they couldn’t say it if it wasn’t true, right? Apparently they can. Not only does it not have a 100ft range, it drops the signal as soon as I leave the room where my phone is. I have $10 wireless speakers from discount stores that work on the other side of my house. If you want an  inexpensive nice sounding Bluetooth speaker and don’t need to stray far from the audio source, buy this one. If you need wireless range, pick something else.

I have done all I can do, and so now I am back to using my trusty IHome bluetooth speaker (which I bought at Radio Shack two years ago and still works like a champ.  It does not sound as good as the Oontz Speaker, but I do not have to replace it 6 times per year.  Amazon or Cambridge SoundWorks should reach out to me now.  I will keep you all posted.I have purchased several of these little Blue-tooth speakers to carry with me on picnics, place around the house for music while I am cleaning, and to carry outside for cook outs or poker night.  I bought the best one from Radio Shack for $39, and that tennis ball sized I-Home speaker was the best until Oontz.  I got the sweet red Oontz speaker a couple of weeks ago, and this evening-bag sized speaker beats all five of its predecessors in sound AND price.  My husband and I listened to some of the glorious love songs of Whitney Houston Sat night over Rhapsody connected via Bluetooth to the Oontz.  We never got up to full volume, but it sounded like that angel was singing in our den, with a choir surrounding us.  Sunday we used it to watch a movie on my tablet.  When the bad guys were surrounded I could hear the bullets whizzing past my ears. That is a STEREO.  I plan to order a couple more in a few weeks.  Once again, Amazon Prime came through with a fine product at an excellent price and two day shipping was free, as always.  Thank you, Cambridge SoundWorks for giving us Boze Quality at a price we all can pay!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simply the best. I’ve owned DOSS, JBL, Anker, Cambridge, Jambox you name it.  I always find myself reaching for my Oontz (I’ve owned 4 models currently have 3 gave first one away. 8 years old still sounds impeccable with very minor glitches with BT connectivity.)  they ate just the most compact and lightweight and sounds freaking incredible. Crisp yet has a deep rich bass. Buy it! Trust me. Best bang for your buck, no doubt. If it doesn’t workout, you can always return it for free with Prime**photo is of my 2 new ones. Oontz Angle Solo is the Smaller one and is for traveling and boyyyy is it  L O U D  for a singular speaker and bass is surprisingly richer than the Angle 3, the one next to it which is the medium sized one with double speakers?..oh well I’l take it!)

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought three Bluetooth speakers hoping ONE would be usable.  All three ended up being keepers for different reasons. I bought the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3, the Anker Classic Portable, and the Boombotix REX.Portability:  All three are fantastic, no real difference.  If you want to nitpick, the Boombotix is the smallest, the Anker is next, and the Cambridge is the largest.  But again, none of them are really different.  I give an edge to the Boombotix for it's clip, it's more flexible. The clip is super hard to get open though. You aren't clipping it to anything thick.Construction and Ergonomics: All three seem durable and well built.  The Anker is clearly the best of the three. It's classy, attractive, and feels substantial.  And it doesn't walk itself around too much with vibration.  But the On/Off switch is terrible.  It's tiny and hard to use, you have to use your fingernail.  The other buttons are functional, but not as easy to use as the other two. The Boombotix is sturdy and easy to use, the buttons are a little close together, but they work well. It's walks around a little on a hard table, but not terribly. You will have to watch it though, or it will eventually fall off a table.  The Cambridge Angle 3 is sturdy and I love the shape. It works really well being able to either lay it down or stand it up. The function buttons are easy to use.  The On/Off button is not great, it's too small and in an obscure location. So much so that they have to put a little sticker pointing to it.  The rubber end caps are a mixed blessing.  I think they will help protect it, but they get really dirty really fast.  They pick up every tiny little bit of dust.  I recommend standing it up if you put a lot of volume through it because once the bass starts to thump it will bounce and wiggle it's way all over the place.  It's actually kinda funny looking.  But standing up the passive radiator on the bottom doesn't propel it all over.Sound: I was actually impressed with all three. None of them are on par with the large Sound Dock or Klipsch type speakers, but they could hardly be expected to compete with those at this size and price.The Cambridge is my favorite because it has more bass than the other two.  It's a clear winner in bass response. probably about 10-15% more. And that's important to me. The Anker actually has the best overall sound.  It's rich and clean. It's probably the ""best"" speaker of all three.  And the Boombotix is clearly the loudest.  It really puts out some sound.  none of them sound bad at all.  I would have been happy with any of the three if I hadn't heard the others.  But hearing them side by side the Angle 3 fits what I need best.Connectivity: None were bad, but the Boombotix lost connection first, the Angle 3 and the Anker had no trouble at all at 30ft even through walls (but none liked going through a stone fireplace LOL).  None were an issue connecting.  They were all easy as pie to pair.  The Anker was slowest when powering on and trying to find my phone, but we're talking about less than 10 seconds total time for the slowest.Intangibles: The Boombotix has some features that are really appealing. There's an audio out jack, which you can use to run a second speaker (of any make).  So that give you options. Send Bluetooth to the speaker and then it will send it to a second speaker. If you don't have a Bluetooth connection on one of your larger speakers you can send signal to the REX and it will connect to your larger speaker.  Options are nice.I chose the Angle 3, it fits my needs best with the best imitation of bass, but the others are good enough that I've decided to keep them and use them too.  The Anker is nicest, and the Boombotix is loudest and most versatile.  I can't really speak to longevity since I haven't had them very long, but I don't think any of them will die on me. Don't be afraid to buy any of these. Just pick the one that fits best.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like any product, this speaker has both good and less than good points.  Having just received it, I am limited to immediate experience, although thus far more good than bad:Oontz Angle 3 Speaker (Geez, what a name!) appears well constructed, with good, solid feeling to it; although it isn't at all heavy.  It doesn't have any apparition nor feeling of being loosely constructed, with good and tight fitting rubber seals and grommet for power/hard cable connection port.  It was a bit difficult to get grommet open for charge the first time, but using some blunt tool removes it easy enough...Make sure you don't use anything like a sharp knife or like edged tool, because the rubber grommet could be accidentally cut easily enough when trying to lift it out initially. That's not a point for complaint, because speaker is supposed to be water proof enough to take in the shower, although user pamphlet expressively warns against full submersion.  I as well like the fact the pamphlet is well written, easy to understand in explaining functions and set up, and I am thrilled by the fact it is completely in English; as opposed to multi language documents that are written in several languages at microdot font. It's definitely a high point for me to see the instructions are completely in English, but higher still, designed and engineered in America! It is manufactured in China however (What isn't these days?), and I would have preferred American manufacturing and paid more for it if it was.Bluetooth pairing with my iPhone 7 Plus was simple and easy, and activated the pairing mode was very easy, requiring only the user depress and hold the Bluetooth button, which is lit when in use, for a few seconds until it reacts by fast flash.  After that, it's just a matter of selecting it in iPhone settings menu, and it will continue to ""look"" for the speaker after powering on and off, or turning it on for other sessions.  Although it hasn't yet been a problem for me with Oontz speaker, it is sometimes important to reselect chosen device in iPhone if you want another device selection (such as Plantronics headset or other device); although that's iPhone's issue and not Oontz Angle 3 Speaker's.So how does it sound? (Thought you'd never ask!):  It's a fairly good, responsive speaker with good resonating effects, deep base response, and good mid and high end response.  Bear in mind this is a small, portable speaker running off an internal battery, so if you're wanting several hundred watts to rival Bose speakers, this ain't it! But it's no slouch of a portable speaker either, and it would be absolutely perfect for bedside, hotel, bathroom-shower morning music and like use.  It would be perfect for kids' rooms, although no kid is truly happy unless he can annoy parents with high volume, preferably including the neighbors while at it, and this little speaker just isn't made for window-shattering output.It gets a little tricky if your playlists are ""eclectic from hell"" like mine are! Neal Young and Rolling Stones comes out great using iPhone's ""Small Speakers"" EQ setting, Temptations does better using ""R&B"" or ""Pop,"" and I have yet to isolate best for Grateful Dead...But ""Rock"" comes near (but not quite there) the mark. Junior Walker imposes a problem I have yet to solve...And who can live without?  All in, you'll likely find a good setting for one album or genre of music, but you would do well to expect to use more than one if you really like your music like I do. Still, that no buzz killer by me. I like it just as much! Again, if you want to share your music with residents two flights up or around the block, this won't be your answer, but I have a 700 watt Yamaha receiver to accomplish that need anyway.Oontz Angle 3 speaker comes partially charged enough to pair and try right out of the box, although I soon connected it to supplied cable and to a USB charger I already had.  Instructions say it can take ""5-6 hours to fully charge a low battery,"" but how ""low"" it is on delivery is anyone's guess.  Good news is you can listen while charging it, and it's recommended to fully charge initially. I note user pamphlet states higher volume level will affect play time, but it says you'll get ""up to 12 hours at 2/3 volume.""Hands Free function for telephone user however, does present a weak point.  Sound of incoming party is reasonably good and nothing to complain about, but the microphone on the Oontz Angle 3 does indeed leave much to be desired! I tried it in a reasonably quiet surrounding without background noise, a little less than two feet away in normal voice that I would use with other hands free telephone devices, using my own voicemail message to gauge sound quality. The result was very tinny, with a very distant reception that gives perception of being very far from the microphone when you're not.  Since I don't expect to ever much rely on that function anyway, at most to grab a very important call while in the shower or like setting, that's no deal breaker to me.  If you expect to make a lot of hands free telephone use however, you should be aware of that and immediately test it to see if it's something you can rely on. The upside is it automatically went into telephone mode and enabled the microphone without having to switch, and it immediately returned to playing music once call was terminated. Since cell phone issues can be sourced to any number of reasons (connection, device location, etc,), it isn't always evident for where the problem cause is...So test that soon, once you get it!All in, end of the day, and bottom line:  This is a great deal!  I believe I am getting more than what I would expect for $25 Bluetooth-connected, small portable speaker, and it sounds really good in the entire room, and isn't limited to being sweet-spot in front of it. The base comes most from the bottom of speaker and has easily discernible mid and high range outputs, which is hard to find on small speakers at all, let alone portable AND Bluetooth. It will easily be benefited in smaller space with tiled walls like most bathrooms tend to be, and neither it nor the manufacturers fear a hot shower, provided you don't ask it to scrub your back. It would work very well in a kitchen, bedside or hotel room without causing the front desk to ask you for an much earlier check out...Like now or sooner.  It has it's limitations like anything else, but for reasonable volumes and user expectations, it's still a score!  There's only one thing I would want that wasn't part of the buying experience: Free shipping from Amazon (Hint, hint!!).  I would buy another and I do recommend it! Thumbs up, stars, and a few backflips...And nobody is giving me anything for this review.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker is very poor quality. I've used it for several months now and get more frustrated every time. I listen to it for about 30-45 minutes at a time. Sometime is works great and sometimes I want to throw it out the window. The issue is with the Bluetooth. Most days, the speaker has little hiccups where it looses Bluetooth connection, pauses the music, and then reconnects. I then have to press play again on my phone. This regularly happens 2-3 times PER song! Incredibly frustrating. I tried using an aux cable to get around the Bluetooth issue, but using an aux cable lowers the overall volume of the speaker significantly. Do not buy!

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I do not suggest getting these speakers at all.  The first one I got stopped working within the  first couple months, I had gotten the extended warranty and was sent a replacement,  that one stopped working as well within a couple months.  They sent yet another replacement even though I mentioned my concern that the speakers weren't working after a few months.  The replacement again lasted a few months and stopped.  I wrote the company again and they are saying sorry you're no longer under warranty not our problem.  I will never buy speakers from this company again and suggest others not to, especially when they keep breaking down so quickly and the company says basically yeah we aren't standing behind our product.  Look elsewhere for speakers and know even with extended warranty they won't back up products not even a year old.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product!! I purchased this for a cross country road trip in an '80s Camaro with a busted radio. It worked great for my cross country trip; I could hear it over road noise and the battery life was sufficient for an 8 hour day.  (The cigarette lighter was also busted so it was important for the battery to last as long as possible.)  The sound quality is also excellent!  It really thumps when you crank it up.  I love this little speaker!  I use it all the time at home, its so portable and again I stress the great battery life.  It goes for quite a while between charges.  I had no problems pairing it with my Samsung Galaxy S6.  I also like the rubber feet it has which made it stay right on the dash where I placed it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I cross shopped the Oontz Angle 3 and Amazon Basics speaker (the cheaper 2.5-watt speaker from Amazon, NOT the 3W amazonbasics speaker). I was surprised to see no reviews comparing the two since they are a similar price so this experience may help others like myself.I use this with a fire tablet HD8 which we keep in Show mode in the kitchen (the stock speakers on the tablet are terrible).SOUND QUALITY: The sound quality between these two is very close. If you are not picky you may not notice a difference at lower volumes.  However the Oontz Angle 3 has better clarity particularly when the volume is turned up. I would place the sound quality similar to the larger Amazon Echo cylinder (I have the 1st gen Echo). However these both will get louder than the Echo so they may sound better if you like loud music (see volume below).BASS: Don't expect this to shake the house like your aftermarket car stereo system. There is just a slight thump and nothing that will cause vibrations. But enough that you know bass belongs in that part of the song. That thump is more subdued in the AmazonBasics speaker but only slightly.VOLUME: Both of these get quite loud. We never have this at full volume, usually keep the Oontz at about 60-70% volume at most, and this is loud enough that we are basically yelling over the speaker to talk in the kitchen.CONNECTIVITY and BATTERY: I combined these topics because both are excellent, connecting either the AmazonBasics or Oontz was a breeze. Neither breaks connection and both batteries have yet to die after weeks of staying on. Oontz includes a 3.5mm stereo aux cable and Amazon does not. This may be a deal breaker for some of you. Note that BOTH have the jack on the device, but only the Oontz gives the wire.One caveat: The Oontz will power down if it is not plugged in. Supposedly this is not the case if it is connected to an Echo. However when connected to my Fire HD8 tablet in Show mode, it does still power down. To work around this I have to keep the Oontz plugged in so it won't shut down. This is not the case with AmazonBasics 2.5W speaker connected to my HD8.BUILD QUALITY: I was impressed with both of these speakers build quality. The Oontz has a more rubber feel whereas AmazonBasics is plastic. Buttons are easier to press on the Amazonbasics speaker and also easier to see. The reason being that the Oontz is black rubber with black volume symbols so you really need to look at it to find the button. But that is a minor gripe. When used with an Alexa device, you'll probably adjust volume by voice.I think the Rubber would do better with drops or being thrown in a bag, but I did not actually test this. With that said if you plan to keep the speaker in one place I don't think either of these will fall apart easily.OTHER: The Oontz can be placed vertically or horizontally. The AmazonBasics speaker can only be placed horizontally. If your space is tight, Oontz may win out here.One last thing: THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WITH THE SPEAKER ITSELF. However, this applies if you are planning to use this like I am. This speaker is connected to my HD8 via bluetooth. When music is playing, the tablet has such a poor mic that it cannot pick up the ""Alexa"" command unless I pause the music. When no music is playing the mic seems to pick up just fine. This has bothered me to the point I may just put my regular first gen Echo back in the kitchen. It's frustrating to play music and not be able to stop it with your voice (yes I know, first world problems).CONCLUSION: Both are quality products, Oontz just barely edges out the AmazonBasics speaker in clarity and bass but only at higher volumes. Also Oontz includes a 3.5mm wire whereas AmazonBasics speaker does not. Both will greatly augment sound quality of an Amazon Fire tablet or Echo Dot. Quality is similar to the cylinder Amazon Echo but louder.Edited for clarification.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this speaker for several months, and it is fantastic. It's very small, with a similar footprint as a cellphone, and the build quality is shockingly good, with a metal grill, high quality plastics, and nice silicone end pieces.It has excellent sound with surprisingly good bass. I have started using it as a practice amp for my electric bass and it sounds good, though it does distort if I play loudly on the lowest string. It would work perfectly as a small guitar amp. The big surprise is the sheer volume, though - it has annoy your neighbor kind of volume in a tiny package. It is very slightly quieter than a good set of desktop speakers on maximum volume, enough to hurt if you're sitting right next to it.The battery life is great, and it doesn't lose much over time either, it still had a 90% charge after two months on a shelf. It connects instantly and reliably to my gen 1 pixel and mobile playback controls work perfectly. (volume up/down, play/pause, and forward/back)From some other reviews it seems like there may be some minor quality control issues, but Amazon has a fantastic return policy, so don't worry about it. I haven't had any problems with it at all.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this portable speaker to play music when we go to the beach, an upcoming rafting trip, upcoming camping trip etc. I was immediately surprised by the size of this speaker - it's much smaller than I thought it would be - which is great in my books as that adds to portability. Secondly, I played a song on it (Despacito) and Luis Fonsi absolutely killed it on these speakers! It was LOUD and clear. Bass was beautiful too. Pairing with my iPhone literally took seconds.Now with my camping and rafting trips a few weeks out, I placed this speaker in my home office while still paired with my phone. I got an incoming call and it unintentionally went to this speaker. Call quality and volume = beautiful. But what really surprised me was that the built in mic works great too! If any of you work from home and take phone calls/conference calls - this little speaker will quickly become your best bud. I have a landline that i use to make phone calls primarily because of the speakerphone - i no longer need that as using this speaker in conjunction with my phone is the ultimate combo.Love love it. Highly recommend.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, it's well-packaged -- cleverly boxed, secure enough for shipping, but not difficult to open. Second and perhaps even more surprising, the instruction pamphlet (a) exists on paper, (b) is written in English by someone who's obviously fluent in English, (c) makes sense from beginning to end, and (d) isn't really even needed, as the set-up is mostly intuitive. I'm a little flabbergasted how easy it was to set up this device. From signing for the delivery to singing along with the rock'n'roll took about ten minutes.Most important, though, is the sound, and I had my doubts. I work 13-hour shifts and wanted to hear my tunes in a *loud* workplace, before and after my 9-5 colleagues go home. But my desk is only about 15 feet from the roaring HVAC unit that makes luxuries like *thinking* and conversation with coworkers difficult.Well, to my honest surprise, this affordable and silly-named ""OontZ Angle 3"" delivers. It puts out sound that's clear and foot-tappable. and even at 100% volume, there's no distortion. But I had to turn it down; it was too loud. It's now set at about 75% of its maximum volume, and that's enough to defeat the HVAC, even when I'm at the distant end of the room. I'm planning to buy a second unit for my home.PS. I can't rate the battery life, as I'm keeping it plugged in and charged 24/7.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great, battery last for many hours, and it can play while it is charging. There are days where I start playing music when I wake up in the morning and I don't need to start charging it until dinner time or later. I've used it outside while working in the yard and the sound projects a surprising distance considering the size of this thing, and with no distortion! To reiterate that last point, this thing can get LOUD, especially indoors. No problems with the Bluetooth pairing, very simple to manage. Bass is directed downwards and seems to reflect off of whatever it is sitting on, so you will get better sound when placed on a hard surface. When on a hard surface, the bass sounds quite good for the price of this thing. You definitely lose out on some audio quality when this is on soft surface like a couch/bed or in your hand, it is very noticeable when you place it on a proper surface. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality Bluetooth speaker at a very reasonable price.

Also playback would randomly speed up and slow down.  It just became unusable.  I never dropped it or abused it in any way.  Just set it on the shelf and connected via Bluetooth.  Its not my phone that is causing the problems because I can stream to my BOSE radio all day long with none of the issues I have mentioned here.  Using earbuds are likewise fine.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Man, this is tough to review. All 3 do a commendable job given their size and price, and based on that alone I'd give them all 5 stars. Given the sound quality itself, however, I'd say they sounded good but not great, which is why I ultimately gave each of them 4 stars - MAYBE 5 stars for the SoundCore 2. You're definitely trading some sound quality for portability.All 3 seemed well built and solid. The SoundCores were a notch heavier, and while all 3 have an Aux input jack, the SoundCores don't include the cable. The OontZ does. All 3 include a USB-based charging cable but none include a plug-in wall adapter. I thought the OontZ had better/clearer instructions, but they all easily connected to Alexa. Haven't tried anything else yet. The OontZ and SoundCore2 are ""splash"" waterproof, the SoundCore is not. The SoundCores play a short multi-note audio tone when powered on, and when connecting to a bluetooth source, with no apparent way to turn it off, but it was subdued and I didn't find it objectionable. The OontZ is silent. All 3 have raised buttons for power, volume, bluetooth, etc, but I DON'T like that they're all the same color as the case. You either have to shine a light to see them, or fumble around by feel. Annoying and unnecessary. I don't care that making them white or gray or whatever ""ruins the clean lines"" - it's a portable speaker, not a piece of furniture.Now, I'm not an audiophile, but I do understand that you're never going to get subwoofer-like bass and top quality sound from small speakers like these. For this comparison I listened to the same songs played from the same source (Alexa), at the same volume, 30 degrees off center and from about 8' away. No equalizing - just as-is straight out of Alexa.OontZ Angle 3:Louder than the SoundCores. Highs and midranges were distinctly brighter and clearer as well - actually quite impressive. Even my self-proclaimed ""tone deaf"" wife could easily hear the difference. Unfortunately, while that end of the spectrum sounded good, it also kinda drowned out whatever bass was present. You could say there was a bass ""presence"", but it was more of a ""whap"" than a ""thump"". Overall it made the sound seem a little unbalanced toward the high end.Anker SoundCore:Highs and midrange were more subdued, which is probably why it seemed quieter. Compared the OontZ this speaker sounded a little like it was laying face down in a pillow. Even when Alexa ""talked"" you could tell her voice was more muffled. That, however, allowed more of the bass to shine thru and made for a little more balanced overall sound. When a song hit a bass note it was a little more pronounced and deeper than the OontZ. Now (depending on your ""ear""), if you just walked into a room with the SoundCore playing you may not notice the more subdued highs, but right after hearing the Oontz it was quite noticeable.So bottom line, if you dig highs & midrange and don't care as much about bass, the Oontz is definitely your speaker. If you like a more balanced sound at the cost of brighter highs, the SoundCore is the way to go.Me? I'd go with the OontZ by the slightest of margins. While the SoundCore may have a slight edge in bass, the OontZ's has a bigger edge in highs - making it the better overall speaker (to me).UPDATE 10/31/2018:The SoundCore 2 arrived. Noticeably richer sound than the original SoundCore - mainly due to a fuller bass. Won't rival a sub-woofer but it was impressive for such a small speaker. Highs seemed slightly more pronounced as well (vs the original SC), but it was hard to tell if that was real or it just seemed that way next to the richer bass. Overall the fullest, richest sound of the 3 speakers, and right now my top pick. Being $10 more you'd expect it to sound at least a little better, and it does.It also adds ""splash"" waterproofing, with a convenient tab you can pull to open the rubber cover that protects the jacks. The OontZ requires some digging to lift enough of the cover to grab.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeah, I expected a device which I presumed would be about 7 or 8 inches across.... is 5.3 inches across (from the manual). I hadn't looked for dimensions before I placed the order, so be advised. So, from the small size, I don't get much stereo separation.I've powered it on and paired it to Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit, this took about 15 seconds start to finish using Blueman and choosing this as an Audio Sink. Pairing was very quick and easy, the first pairing was the only attempt because it was successful.Listening to DJ Basilisk - Circadian Rhythms and Heliocentric. So, how is the bass response? Low frequency roll-off is substantial, despite designer efforts for good bass (bottom surface is a PASSIVE bass radiator... openings are over half of the bottom surface area). Very strong high frequency output. This device will need substantial EQ work. Total peak sound level is high, but at that level, the distortion is also high.Can't speak to battery life, I'm testing it using the charge which  it had from the factory. It is labeled for 5V 1 Amp, comes with a USB to Micro cord of about 18 inches. This Oontz does not come with a charger. Manual claims 6 hours to fully charge and 12 hours play time at 2/3rds volume.Water resistance is IPX5, which the manual says is splash resistance only, no puddles, do not submerge.Manual does not describe any other uses than as a stereo speaker.""Crystal Clear Stereo Sound"". Uhhh, no. Very little channel separation, left driver is 3/8"" from the right driver, my ears are spaced further apart than that. Each ear hears both left AND right.Is it worth the money? Yeah, I think it is, but my only other BT speakers are about the same SOUND quality and 2/3rds the price.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got the speaker because I listen to either music or stories all the time, working in the garden, taking showers , at the beach. I got it for Christmas this year and loved it until a month ago when it's simply stopped working. The red and blue lights indicate it is taking a charge. But it will not connect to my phone anymore. It's hard to believe that at only 4 months old oh, the manufacturer wants no part of replacing it. So if you're lucky and yours works you'll be very happy. If you're like so many of us other ones, it's going to stop working and you're going to be sad like me

Then tried to turn on one day , nothing,blue charging life would not even illuminate. This is my second electronic device from china, and they both quit after a short period. I believe devices are engineered to burn out in a short period. Most electronic devices in my experience last forever. American made always used to last forever!!!.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great size, easy to connect, no tech issues or errors.  Overall, the sound is great and this speaker gets loud without any problematic distortion at high volumes. I found the mids a bit too strong (though they are clear) and the bass to be lacking. The treble seems about right - perhaps a bit bright but definitely not harsh.  I'm not sure how people can say this thing has good bass, even for its size.  I was not expecting much bass at all from this speaker given it's size, but there are comparable speakers out there that do have more bass (e.g. jbl core, anker soundcore). However, those speakers come at a higher price point and often the sound is more directional and fire sound forward, not up or 360 degres around. Plus, the bass in other speakers often comes with more distortion at higher volume levels.  For this speaker's intended use for me, I'd rather have clear, loud sound than more bass that sounds bad when cranking the volume up.The build quality on this unit is just great.So overall, for the price, I'm pretty pleased. I didn't want to spend too much money on a speaker like this.  If it somehow had a touch more bass I'd give it 5 stars.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am skeptical of any claims of high quality audio from basically any Bluetooth speaker but I needed one and came across this one and gave it a shot. While it lacks the power and obviously size to reproduce high fidelity audio it does a surprisingly good job considering the odds stacked against it. Definitely one of the best Bluetooth speakers in this price point which is pretty reasonable. Is it a couple hundred dollar Bose or something along those lines? No but for the price its a dang good little speaker.Update 8/24/19Our first one is still going strong and we have purchased a second. The sound quality definitely is better when using the 3.5 mm connection but the volume definitely seems lower. Unless you need the extra volume because of an overly noisy environment I would suggest trying the speaker this way. Still happy with our purchase which is why we picked up a second.

We had one of those old speakers where you have to plug your phone in and I was getting sick of not being able to use my phone when at the beach/pool because it was plugged in. This was the perfect solution! Not only can I use my phone no because it's bluetooth. BUT it's waterproof and sand proof. No more crackly speakers this one has super clear audio and can get really loud too! Can you tell I'm not a tech nerd :) I don't know much about technology but for me this was such an awesome solution. Also really love how quick my phone can connect to it. Took like 15 seconds for me to figure out how to connect it! Because it's waterproof we can leave it on our patio all the time too. We obviously have super high humidity and torrential downpours all the time so I don't have to worry about this. When we're ready to party all i have to do is turn it on and put the play list on! Plus you seriously can't beat the cost!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"It was becoming quite tedious to unplug and plug my speakers every time I wanted to listen to music in another room. Therefore, I wanted a wireless speaker that I could easily grab around the house, for when Im taking a shower, cooking, working, etc.This speaker does the job. However, the sound quality is nothing to boast about, its basically louder and slightly better than my cellphone (I have an iphone5), which is not great for a speaker. Anytime I play anything with something of a bass, or high note/pitch, these speakers do not play it super well and there is slight distortion.My other speaker which was not wireless where just basic desk top speakers, and somehow the sound played better out of them..In essence, this speaker does the job. The ease of moving these around and the ok price tag, makes me keep them and accept the sometimes distortion of sound.

The Oontz Angle 3 plays mostly music. Pretty manageable in general, solid range, dexterous, and holds up well in sunlight. I put this bad boy in the bottom of my tub filled with water for over 12 hours. Well it didn't work after so I bought another and tried 8 hours. That one also broke so I bought a third and tried 6 hours. Same thing so dropped it to 4. This time it held up and worked after so I tried 5 and it died. Drew the line below 5 above 4. So there's your marker if you are looking to drop it in the lake for a bit although I'm not sure why you would want to do that. If that is your goal maybe find an under water speaker and don't rely on this you weirdo.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this speaker.  I bought it because it was cheaper than similar speakers.  It's a good looking portable speaker and it doesn't draw a lot of attention to itself.  I think I generally get 8-10 hours of play time from it, depending on how loud I have it set.  This is enough playback time for me.  It feels light and well built. Connecting via bluetooth is easy and simple.  The reason it receives three stars is sound quality.  It can be a little muddled at mid-volume.  I'm not looking for perfection from a small, cheap speaker but my old Bem speaker did a better job at moderate volume.  Granted, this is all based on personal preference so it might sound fine to you.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this to go with an Echo Dot. The Bluetooth works great, the sound is clear, and the battery lasts a long time. But other reviewers' claims of good bass response are crazy talk. I guess compared to a cell phone that may be correct, but even compared to a normal Echo (not Dot) this thing is weak in the bass department, to the point that I find listening to it really annoying and unpleasant. The thing is, it shakes and vibrates like it's really working hard, so I even went so far as to open it up to verify that the speakers hadn't been wired out of phase, but nope they were wired correctly. I'll probably add a woofer output jack, but in reality I'll probably end up giving it to Goodwill.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this speaker hoping that it would have good Bluetooth range and it didn't disappoint. I'm able to move it freely around the house and even outside on our patio and it stays connected ( specs state up to 100 ft. range). This is a lot better than another speaker I have which disconnects frequently at very modest distances.I like the shape and the sound quality is quite good considering the price. Connecting to my PC or smartphone is simple and the volume is very good as well.It would be a five star item except for a couple of things. While I understand the effort to make the speaker water resistant the small rubber ""press in place"" cover over the USB charging port is a bit fussy to press into place and stay there. Also, the waterproof on/off membrane switch seems like a delicate thing that could prove to be a weak point going forward. Time will tell. All in all I am delighted with this speaker and I believe most buyers will be as well.

Since we haven't had any outdoor parties since then, I forgot that I'd left it out there. I came across it today. That's right. This thing survived SEVEN MONTHS outside—including a harsh Ohio winter.

This is small and compact so I can use it in my car or when working from my laptop to listen to podcasts and music. Its perfect. It pairs effortlessly with my phone. It's small and light to carry around. The indicators work as you would expect. At this price point this is almost perfect. The only critique is I wish I could have bought 2 to pair together to get a stereo effect with music. I bought this for my car (which has no bluetooth) and I bought two Aomais Sport II for my home office. I love the OontZ better than the Aomais for ease of use and pairing. I have had trouble pairing with the Aomais and though I like the sound prompts of the latter,, it is really annoying to hear ""charging"" repeatedly when I'm trying to use it while charging! Why would they design a prompt like that? So OontZ gets my vote hands down. And I must add I am not a techie by any means so these purchases were a leap of faith but I already am so grateful for the pricepoints that made me willing to try them--they are enabling me to listen to podcasts and music wherever I am in my home.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this exclusively in the shower in my small bathroom.  I purchased this to replace a speaker that I have had for about 3 years. It was a small 5-watt outdoor speaker from Aukey that had since been discontinued. The battery life started to deteriorate, so I started to look for a slightly better sound on a budget, and of course, better battery life.  After some research I settled on the Oontz.  This speaker more than fits the bill!a) SOUND: The sound is fuller than my previous speaker, doesn't distort, and with 10 watts of power, it is LOUDER (especially in a small room, i.e. bathroom).b) BATTERY: The battery life is phenomenal! I know I only use it for about 25 minutes a day, but I love having to charge it only once a month at most. The remaining battery charge conveniently appears in my phone's Bluetooth settings which helps me keep track of it.c) WIRELESS RANGE: Big improvement over my previous speaker.  The Oontz has a 100 foot range (unobstructed); I can keep my phone charging in one room while playing music in the shower.  I couldn't do this reliably before.d) CONTROLS:  Button layout works well.  The volume and track controls share the same 2 buttons but it's a simple matter of press vs press and hold.  Play and pause are on the same button as well.  You have one button for phone call and Bluetooth controls: answer and end calls (with one press), reject calls (press and hold) and pairing mode (press and hold).  You have a dedicated power button and it is alone on another side of the speaker (with the auxiliary input jack and charging port), you will not accidentally power the speaker off when trying to operate any of the other buttons.  You have 2 LED lights, a red one by the power button and a blue one with the other controls.  These lights prove useful when determining the status of certain functions and features.e) FLEXIBLE: You can use this with any bluetooth device (wirelessly) or use it with any device with a headphone jack via the auxiliary input jack (wired).  You can use it while plugged into the charger, or not.  You can keep it plugged in without any detrimental effects to the battery (per the manufacturer) if you're interested in using this with an Amazon Echo Dot or the like.f) PRICE: All of this for a very reasonable price.  The same price, in fact, that I paid for the Aukey speaker I had previously.I was so impressed with this little speaker that I purchased one of it's big brothers, The Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, not too longer after!

I mainly listen to jazz/rock fusion and progressive rock (among the various fashions of music), and the work that these musicians place on recording is performed with detail and intricacy, and for the listener to appreciate the effort achieved in the works, far more is required from the system than one dinky little micro-speaker can produce.Incomes the OontZ Gen 3 Bluetooth Speaker system, and no more sad reminders of how much I’ve missed the full, rich blend of bass, midrange, and treble tonalities. This unit’s output is far more than are my simple needs of bringing music to my home patio or kitchen. One might imagine his daughter cranking up some cray cray hip hop on this beast.A word to the wise (or, even if you’re a couple fries short an order): get a nice graphic equalizer to bring the sound together. They’re easy to use and graphic equalizers make all the difference in the world. The OontZ Gen 3 pumps A LOT of lower-range bass, and you may need to adjust the volumes on both your device and the OontZ Gen 3. I personally lowered the volume on the OontZ Gen 3 to a little more than halfway up, and I do all the volume controlling from my device; it’s easier that way IMO.So, whether you listen to the Dixie Dregs or the Dixie Chicks, this speaker system will make your little heart happy, AND IT’S SO INEXPENSIVE!Perfect price!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this speaker for about a year and a half, and in the beginning, it worked perfectly.  However, about 6 months ago, I noticed the Bluetooth stopped working, and it won't wirelessly pair with my ipod anymore.  But it's possible that's more the fault of my ipod (it's kind of old), and I can still use the AUX plug, so no harm no foul, I guess.  However, even when I pair it with my iphone, it sometimes doesn't work or requires me to fiddle with it in order to get to work.  Also, I had the speaker playing yesterday after having charged it overnight, and it kept cutting off for some reason.  Maybe it didn't charge sufficiently (I'm not sure why that would be the case), so I will try again today to use it, and hopefully the problem doesn't repeat itself.  Overall, I have enjoyed having it, the sound quality is pretty good (at least in my opinion), and I would buy it again even knowing that it might only work perfectly for about a year or so.Update: Speaker no longer holds a charge no matter how long you plug it in for. I was hoping this would last me longer than it actually did. Going to try a different brand next time.2nd Update: I contacted the company and they sent me a second speaker, free of charge.  It works perfectly.  Customer service for this company is really on point and is greatly appreciated.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"All the 5 star reviews on this speaker claiming that it has great sound quality are pretty deceiving for those looking for decent sound. This is a pretty poor speaker. At low volume it sounds hollow with no fullness to the sound. It's not much better at higher volumes as the treble is harsh and the mids start to blend together. It's very fatiguing to listen to for extended periods.It connects easily and I never had any pairing problems so that at least works well. This would be something that I might take on a camping trip and not worry about destroying. I would suggest doing some research and spending more on a better speaker. You will thank yourself in the end. I own several bluetooth speakers now that I spent quite a bit more on, but they were worth the extra money. However, if you just want something cheap to take on a trip and you don't care if it gets lost or stolen, then this might work out.

Not even in the same league).I A-B these two models, same songs, same settings, even used a db meter to make it legit, apples to apples kind of comparison.The DKnight has a warmer overall sound, great bass and decent mids and highs, unfortunately it seems like its been discontinued, I was going to order 3 more (I already have 3 of them for the fam), you can still find them on ebay but they jack you on the shipping. Now the OontZ was a real surprise, great Bass, has a lot more headroom as far as volume, it can get up to 90db +- (both can), very similar to the output on the DK .Though they're both rated at 10W I felt the OontZ was certainly louder. It might be a little on the bright side, and I dont mean that in a bad way, the Mids & HF really shined through, more so than the DKnight. On your cell or Ipod you can taylor the sound via equalizer so its not a game changer in any way. Both are really fantastic little Bluetooth speakers and anyone searching for  a good quality sound at a great price would be quite pleased with either one of them. I hope DKnight will continue the line but as is all too common it might be the end of the line at least for this model. Thankfully the OontZ is a winner and the cheaper price is a win win IMO.Get the While YOu Can!

The sound quality is fantastic as well. I only have 2 complaints about it.1. It takes an eternity to fully charge, and then the battery drains way faster than I'd like it to (about 3 hours of constant use).2. The Bluetooth distance is very limited. You basically have to keep your phone or music device right next to it or the music starts cutting out and sounding like a skipping CD.So if you want to use it unplugged, make sure you're charge it for a full day before you use it. And keep your audio device within ten feet or so if you want to avoid your music cutting out.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great little sound box. I've had mine for a little over a year now and I've used it for multiple functions. I initially bought it to use at a park for a memorial bbq since the city wanted a much larger deposit for ""amplified"" sound. Since a speaker doesn't count as amplified sound, I decided go that route. This little guy didn't disappoint and the sound carried well over 50 feet in either direction at half volume without sounding like it was coming out of a coffee can.I wouldn't say it's as great as the higher end sound systems you can buy with a seperate sub woofer, but it works very well for me and it is durable. It has been cranked up pretty loud without damage to the speaker. The Bluetooth connectivity is very quick and simple unless the battery is low. I've had this thing going for about 5 hours and never had to charge it. I've taken it camping and I use it on my patio pretty much every weekend. At low volume it sounds good, at high volume it sounds good. Although, I've found that depending on the surface it sits on, it can sound a little different. So I wouldn't recommend sitting it on hollow metal.It's very durable made and I've left it out in the sun and the rain without any issues or signs of sun damage. For the price, this is a very good buy. I didn't get it for free or anything so these are my genuine unbiased opinions.I think I only spent about 30 bucks on it. So I would highly recommend.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a FedEx driver, and wanted a bluetooth speaker that would let me listen to music and especially audiobooks as I drove around. I purchased the first generation OontZ speaker OontZ Angle Bluetooth Speaker [ORIGIINAL] Ultra Portable Wireless with Built in Mic up to 10 Hour Playtime works with iPhone iPad tablet Samsung and smart phones - Black Grille, and it served my purposes fairly well. It wasn't loud enough for our larger package trucks, but for the smaller ones, it worked fairly well. It was a bit of a strain to hear it, though, at highway speeds.I had a charging issue with the speaker after I had been using it for 8 months; I charged it all night, and the next day, it would run for a little while and go dead. I contacted Cambridge, and a helpful rep named Jennifer cheerfully offered to ship me the new OontZ Angle 3 as a free replacement for my older generation model that was acting up. It arrived two days later, and I've been loving it ever since. Even apart from their willingness to replace my product, the customer service is outstanding.Pros: It is louder. I had mentioned that the previous generation was difficult to hear at highway speeds; not the Angle 3. (FedEx Express drivers, note: this speaker will overcome the engine noise for the old Sprinters, the newer Benzes, and of course, the Nissans and the ancient Ford panel vans. The larger W700 and W900 vehicles are still just too loud for this sort of speaker, IMO).I love the play/pause button on the end of the speaker, which allows me to pause an audiobook without messing with my phone. The manual says that this button doesn't work with all apps, but it does work with the Audible app I use.The styling of the Angle 3 is superior to the earlier generation. The stick-on rubber knobs on the bottom of the earlier generation have been replaced by two inch-and-a-half-long rubber strips set into recesses on the bottom of the speaker. I have both in front of me; a gentle push will move the old generation speaker across the table with some resistance, but the Angle 3 is much more resistant to moving. One of the rubber knobs had come off the old model, and I had to stick it back on; I don't see how that sort of thing would even be possible with the Angle 3. As well, there is a rubber-like covering on both ends, and this makes the speaker less angular and ""sharp"".As with the old speaker, the battery life is truly outstanding. I have been surprised at how long a single charge will last.I'm no expert, but I find the clarity of the sound excellent. It certainly serves my purposes for listening to audiobooks.My single ""con"" for the speaker is that it shuts down (to conserve battery) after fifteen minutes of non-use, if it is not plugged in. Not that it's difficult to turn back on! But I'd prefer an option that lets it remain on indefinitely. But that is a minor detail, and doesn't keep me from rating this a 5-star product.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this speaker because I was looking for a relatively inexpensive speaker that I can use in the shower. I was looking at a few speakers but eventually decided on the OobtZ because of its features, price and sheer amount of positive feedback. In this review I will focus on the pros and cons that make this speaker a good choice for a speaker under $30.Starting off the shipping was fast as expected. I opened the box and got a fairly simple unvoxing with a charger, manual and 3.5 chord which I was very happy about because many speakers don't come with one. It came with a mostly full battery which was nice.  Initial thoughts on sound were as follows: It has a decent bass for the price and has mids and highs that were clear but a bit crunchy (especially at high volumes). It gets loud enough for a small rom and most certainly a shower or bathroom. Aesthetically it is very slick with a metal grill and rubber endcaps. The size also lends to excellent portability. The controls are easy to use and pairing was very simple. So to sum it all up I will list my personal pros and cons when using the speaker.ProsWater resistance for shower and water useGood portable sizeGood overall soundEasy controls and pairingConsLacks deep bass but this is to be expected with a speaker of this priceCrunchy highs but not so bad that it is hard to listen toNot fully waterproof so don't fully submerge itSo in conclusion this is a very well rounded speaker that is good in all categories but not necessarily amazing in sound which is expected for a $30 speaker. I would say this speaker is great for a shower speaker or something you throw in the bag to a pool, beach or for just casual listening if you don't need top notch sound.

I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks in my car and my phone's speakers aren't loud enough to cut it.  This speaker does the trick.  The sound is really clear and is loud enough that I can listen even when I have studded snow tires on, which make my car a lot louder.  I haven't listened to any music with this yet, so I can't comment on that.I might get some Command velcro stuff to stick it to the dash, but for now, it just lives in the passenger seat.  It's also small enough to fit in my already crowded glove box.  My car has an inverter, so I can charge it right in the car, which is a nice perk.I wish I had thought of this years ago.  I'm no audiophile, but I think the sound is great and the price is right.  My one complaint, that goes for every rechargeable item, is that the battery would be hard to replace.  Batteries don't last forever so this will eventually become an expensive paperweight.  This just creates waste and makes me sad.  Rechargeable items should be designed so that the batteries are replaceable.

Its sound is almost as good as the echo.I've found for better bass, lay it flat, the passive radiators definitely help. We're talking basic features here, but for myself it sounds darn good for $30. As far as longevity goes, I'm on the fence, a 90 day warranty isn't the best and since a lot of reviewers pointed out, they ended up with a paper weight. Also take into consideration that close to 20,000 units have beens sold, so it's fair to say you'll end up with a few bad ones, which is why I opted to spend the three bucks for the additional warranty.I've extracted even more bass from this little guy with my phone's graphic EQ, and the sound doesn't distort or drop off either way.Don't dunk it, but yeah you could take it to the beach, just make sure the rubber flap is closed on the charging port.

Sucky thing is that it's more than 3 months beyond the warranty so I can't return it.I've had it for the past two months and think it's a great product. I've used it in the shower or generally around the house. The sounds is very loud and bright. You can monitor the sound both with the dials or through the source of the sound (e.g. phone or computer). I've used it both with my phone and with my laptop, and it does great at amplifying the sounds when I'm streaming a movie. The charge stays forever. I use it several times a week and have only charged it 2-3 times since I've purchased it.Cons- You can't toggle back and forth for different music. Only pause, and volume.- The bluetooth range doesn't do well when I'm moving it from my downstairs to upstairs without having my phone close. The sounds starts to get choppy. (I'm not quite sure the spacial distance.)

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little speaker is great! We use it every day. I purchased it to use for my daughter's birthday party coming up soon, but we have used it a lot already. The volume goes really loud so I don't think we'll have any problem with it at the party. The sound quality is very good in my opinion. It sounds clear & crisp. We've used it at bedtime & hanging out outside. The only complaint I will say, is you can't go too far away from the speaker if you have it connected to your phone (& carrying it with you) otherwise the connection goes in & out. Battery life seems good. I haven't timed it to see if it matches with what it says. But it seems to last long enough for typical use.*EDIT*We've had it for a month now. We used it at my daughter's birthday party which was held outdoors & it worked perfectly! Love it! Still using it every day whether for bedtime routine, cleaning the house, cooking etc.

I complained and they sent a replacement. Still didn’t work...AND NOW NO SPEAKER CONNECTOR.  The only way I had transmission was if I plugged it into my iPad and it acted as a dumb speaker.  I thought the sound was tinny.  Amazon reps were clueless and poor  communicators. They didn’t give me proper credit.  So frustrating  .....DONT  BUY. i got info from Cambridge and  still didnt work. THEY BLAMED AN APPLE  UPDATE OR SOMETHING. Also  they say the battery has to be fully charged. But no way to measure charge. Five hours should be enough. I am now connecting videos ON MY iPad  to a lovely portable Bose product I bought to use with my old iPod, which I’ve lost. That’s good sound.!But not wireless.  I’m sadly disappointed in the product AND the Amazon reps. Yuk . The last rep was smart and knowledgeable but then we were cut off. I’ve spent hours trying to unravel this problem and on the phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bought my first one of these speakers two and a half years ago, to use with a Raspberry Pi 3B.  I recently added a new Pi 3B+ system to my stable, and have just ordered one of these speakers to go with that Pi, as well.For their size, I like the bass these speakers deliver, and I appreciate that there's is a bit of heft to the devices.  They stay put and don't dance around on a desk vibrating.  The volume is impressive, and without distortion.I've not pushed the battery to see how long it would actually hold up until fully drained - I think the longest I've ever used it ""unplugged"" is about 3-4 hours.  But during that time I noticed no drop in volume or performance.  Pairing is straight forward, and the range covers my entire apartment.Very happy with this speaker, and look forward to receiving the additional one in a day or two.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not listen to the negative reviews, that is either user error or a fluke. Now, I will admit I just got this, and immediately upon seeing its size and weight I thought it was going to be cheap crap. I can’t speak to battery life yet or longevity, and I will update if needed.But let’s just say, sometimes good things DO come in small packages. Seriously, it’s not even as long as my stretched out hand (I put it next to my standard sized men’s wallet to illustrate). In the past I’ve gotten $25 Bluetooth speakers with good reputations (like the “Venstar Taco”) and found the audio quality to be terrible. I’m an audio guy, I have a nice turntable and stereo and I know what I’m looking for.Audio quality:I was astounded that this little thing could put out sound as crisp, clear, present and balanced as it does. My last good sounding bt speaker was 3x the size. For its size & price, it sounds amazing. I tried it with punk, metal, acoustic, alt rock, hip hop, and stand up comedy. It sounds great all around.IF YOU ARE A BASS-HEAD AND WANT A TON OF THUMP, this probably isn’t for you. The audio quality is great, and it’s got some punch in the low end (Queen “Another One Bites The Dust” sounds awesome, but hip hop sounds kinda tame and weak)... But I recommend you look for another oontZ with a bass boost because the sound IS good.Is it loud? It’s KIND OF LOUD. I had my phone up all the way (minus one notch) and the speaker maxed out. It did not distort for me at all, and it was as loud or slightly louder than I need it to be (I want a speaker for showering, doing things around the house, cooking etc). Would it work outside, probably if it’s close by. Could you hear it while sawing wood? Probably not. But I’d imagine it’s comparable to your average similarly priced CD player boom box. I also listen to hard rock and like it loud all of the time, I go to a lot of concerts so I like being overwhelmed by sound. So, it’s decent.Does it pair to your devices easily? Yes. It paired to my iPhone immediately, no hassle. Then without disconnecting my iPhone, I pushed the Bluetooth button on the side and my MacBook recognized it immediately and connected just a couple seconds later. There was no “I have to go to settings and disconnect my phone first, then go through a connect process again with another device”, it’s quick and painless.I definitely recommend, and I would buy this again.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Originally I rated this speaker with a one star rating and my thoughts about its quality .... a volume issue. A day or two later I received a very nice email from a Customer Service Representative stating that my comments were noticed and the company wanted to provide a few hints as to what my issue might be.  I reviewed the list and experimented with their suggestions.  Immediately the volume was where I expected it to be.  My issue was ""Operator Error"".  Today I would rate this speaker as a 5-Star item.  I believe the quality of the speaker and the company should actually be rated higher.  If you are looking for a good looking, powerful speaker that is worth far more than the selling price .... THIS IS IT.I highly recommend this speaker.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in July, and was initially very pleased with the sound, either cabled or bluetooth, the portability, and toughness/waterproof characteristics.  So, after a few months, scratch the ""toughness"" aspect, because like others have noted, and with SO many other products out there, the USB port is mechanically flimsy and after repeated use fatigues and fails.  Why Cambridge Soundworks, like so many other manufacturers, insist on employing USB when all it's used for is power, is beyond me.  Great sound and battery life for the price, but if it's only going to last 3 months I would expect Cambridge Soundworks to take some heat for the number of these things that will be littering the landfills in short order.EDIT:  From 1 Star, to 3.  Based entirely on the response and support from Cambridge Soundworks. (see the comments to this review).  Cambridge Soundworks acted quickly to this issue, and offered a replacement unit.  I received it less than a week ago.  3-Stars from 1 is a good bump.  But the replacement unit has the same somewhat flimsy USB port for charging the unit, so I'm withholding a better rating until I see how this one holds up.  I also asked about disposal of the original but haven't rec'd. an answer to that question; if these thing are basically disposable that would be horrific, since I'm pretty sure that whatever these are made of has no business being in a landfill or the oceans.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have more Bluetooth speakers than one person should own.  I bought this on a whim while it was on sale - and it turned out to be a great decision.I have been using a JBL Flip 4 in my office to listen to music, podcasts, etc. on a low volume while working at my desk.  The one major downside to the JBL Flip 4 is that every time I turn it on or off, the 'connect', 'disconnect' and 'power on' and 'power off' sounds are VERY LOUD and they cannot be altered (at least not that I've found) and it is distracting to others.The OontZ has clear sound, it's small footprint and size are perfect for my application, the connection sound is not distracting or loud and the Bluetooth works flawlessly.  I haven't listened to anything at a moderate or loud setting yet so I can't comment on sound quality beyond a volume setting of '4'.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and I would buy it again.  It's a great speaker that is very intuitive to set up and very easy to use!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"While my out-of-pocket was substantially lower than the asking price (I only spent $10, thanks to an instant coupon and a prepaid Visa rebate from an unrelated purchase), the Angle 3 is still merely an OK speaker.Sound is veerrrrry mid-range-y, and surprisingly even pales compared to the entry-level--and single-speakered!--Sony SRS-XB01 (I primarily used the XB01 for comparison, as it's the closest competitor I own) and is absolutely blown away by the JBL Flip 3/4 speakers. Now, the asking price for the Angle 3 is about 1/3 to 1/4 of the JBLs, but is only a few bucks more than the Sony. And while sacrificing solid bass and scooped mids, what those few dollars exactly gets you is twofold: Volume and battery life. The Oontz has a great battery (a dozen or more hours, vs the XB01's 5-6hrs)! And it's quite a bit louder to boot.You may be asking, ""Why did you give it 4 stars then?"" Well, I didn't exactly get it for music listening. My purpose for this speaker is to use at my couch with a DIY synthesizer setup (a Gakken SX-150mkII, hacked with a custom-built 400mm softpot controller, into a Zoom effects pedal), and in that capacity it works amazingly well. It's funny how intended use can influence desired outcome!All in all, had I bought the Oontz Angle 3 to use for listening to music, I likely would have returned it and put that credit toward a better (albeit more expensive) option. But for the reason I bought it, it is good enough if not great, especially considering what I paid.The questions I'd ask you to ask yourself are these: ""Am I shopping for something to use with my phone's Prime/Spotify/etc. streaming?"" and, ""Can I swing forty to fifty bucks more for a speaker that just plain sounds better?"" If the answer to either or both of these is ""Yes,"" then I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a compact BT speaker.But I like the Angle 3 nonetheless.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not crazy about the Oontz Angle 3.  I have had the Oontz Angle for several years and liked it's operation, still use it!  So when I needed a second speaker, I went straight to the Oontz line.  What I don't like about this design is mostly due to making it water resistant.  The buttons and connections have been relocated to the upper corner on the back.I generally use this with audio cable because the charge on my nano lasts longer than when using bluetooth.  The audio cable connection is not a good location on that top back corner, it sticks out and is in the way.  (much better when located at the bottom of the back).The on/off button is hard to push as it is small and covered with the waterproof material.  The Oontz Angle has more of a sliding on/off switch which is easier to use.The sound with the audio cable is not as loud as it is on my original Oontz Angle.  However, if you use the Angle 3 with bluetooth you DO get the expected volume of sound with this speaker.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, I bought this item quite a while ago (over a year ago), but I figured I'd leave a quick review of it now. Overall, for the money, this is an excellent little speaker. I use it in a very limited fashion. Basically, it's my bathroom (specifically SHOWER) speaker: I take this speaker into the shower with me, and set it on the ledge (it doesn't get wet from the shower there, but it's exposed to lots of humidity, and my wet hands), and use it to listen to NPR in the mornings. That's it. And for this purpose, it's great. Meets my needs perfectly. I chose this speaker because it has great clarity on vocals, and doesn't have TOO MUCH bass, like some speakers from the more major manufacturers. For example, I also have the JBL Charge 3, but it has WAY too much bass for this purpose. I also had the JBL Clip 2, which had the same problem. The Oontz Angle 3, despite its claims of ""Rich Bass"", I find to be more well-balanced, and I specifically bought it BECAUSE it doesn't have too much bass. It's very durable (mine has met with the floor several times, and is still going strong, even a year later), is waterproof, and has great sound for my specific needs. And it's incredibly affordable! I would buy another one if I needed it, but I don't. Not yet, anyway. So, I actually can't offer an opinion of how this speaker performs with music. But for talk radio & podcasts, I found it to be excellent, and great value for money.

It's smaller than another bluetooth speaker I have, but as I began testing, the sound is just as loud and even better quality.  I tested it with Metallica and AC/DC and it played the highs and lows and the bass with no distortion !!!I tested some of the specs that were given like the range of 100 feet for the bluetooth connection.  I didn't have a measuring tape, but I had the music playing from my laptop in the basement and the speaker on the 2nd floor still playing without issue.  I went to the deck which has to be 60 feet away, again no problem.When the speaker arrived it had a charge and I began using.  Then overnight I charged up completely and used over an entire weekend.  I had a major project to do downstairs and had it playing for at least 8 hours Saturday and Sunday.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great little speaker.  Sound quality and volume is better than I would have expected from so small a device, but I still consider it a personal speaker.  Putting it on speakerphone at a table with about 5 people definitely strained its capability.  Spreading out anymore and we would have had trouble hearing the conversation and being heard on the mic.  Using it in the bathroom is excellent however.  I have generally used it in the shower several times a week for the last 2 years.  Plenty loud enough, with headroom to spare.  It has survived plenty of splashing and wet hands.  And, battery life is great.The only annoyance is when I play audiobooks.  Oftentimes the reader will pause between paragraphs or sentences.  If the pause is long enough, the speaker appears to ""sleep"" to save battery.  Waking back up takes less than a second, but is long enough that it will often miss the first word of sentences or paragraphs.  Some books are much worse than others (depending on the reader).

The Bluetooth function pairs quickly with all of my devices.  I also have a Bose SoundLink and the OontZ connects even quicker.  The problem I have is when using it with my MacBook connected to an external monitor.  Then the Bluetooth not only sounds awful with a lot of static, it also interferes with the signal and cuts out the video.  However, if I use the 3.5mm audio cable, it works just fine. The reason I bought this is that MacBooks cut out the sound when using an external monitor.  So you need a speaker like this.  I'm OK with the cable,  just would have preferred using the Bluetooth.It appears to be well constructed.  Haven't run down the battery yet to see how long a charge will last.  It's very easy to set up.  I like it's small size - doesn't take up much space on my desk.  The sound quality is very good for a small speaker - not as good as the Bose, but certainly adequate.  And for the price, it's a pretty good deal.I'll update my review after I get more experience with the speaker.Update March 20, 2019I've now been using this speaker for about 3 weeks and have seen no significant changes.  It works well in Bluetooth mode with all of my devices except my MacBook Air where it has a lot of static.  It does work just fine with the MacBook Air when using the 3.5 mm cable. I've tried it with my wife's MacBook air and my daughter's MacBook air and get the same static in Bluetooth.  So, it's not just my computer.  Other than that, it's a good value for the money.  Seems to be holding up well.  After three weeks of constant use, I still have not had to recharge it.  So, battery life is great.

I tried using it around Christmas and the sound was terrible, like mono. So I figured it was the batteries because it was very low. I fully charged it, and tried again twice, but the battery does not charge very well and even when the battery is charged, it doesn't last. The worst part, the speaker sound is officially busted. It sounds like something from the intercom system back during the war times as seen in movies. The only time I brought it down from the showcase is to charge the batteries, which I would say is no more than a handful because battery did last really well on one charge, and I use it like once a week or every other week for maybe half hour at most. Now it doesn't even charge well and the charge doesn't hold past half hour. Very disappointing because I really liked this while it lasted. I bought this in the summer so it lasted me about 6 months before the speaker busted. Two stars because I did love it before it died.***Update:I just want to say customer service is EXCEPTIONAL. I wish I had reached out to them before I left a poor review, but they reached out and replaced my speaker.

I paired it with my phone too but tried to raise the volume with the plus key and it skipped to the next song.  I don't like that the power button is invisible and hard to find.  I don't like that you can't tell how much charge it has left.  I wish it had like 5 dots that lit up and went down for every 20% of power left.The sound is very good, even loud it's not distorted.  I like to hear news channels from Tune in when I'm in the shower and my bathroom has a fan that turns on when I turn the light on and I can barely hear my tablet when that happens, but with this I can hear it even when the fan and shower is running.  It's also good that it's splash proof in case I drip on it while I'm toweling off.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This angle 3 pretty much lives up to the description. The sound quality is excellent, the battery is great, and I like the style. Unfortunately, they put the audio-in port right next to the power port. This means if you're using your unit in analog audio mode AND you're charging, you get significant output noise, even when no audio is playing. It's a real bummer. To make the line noise go away, either don't charge the unit, or use only bluetooth.Speaking of bluetooth, this unit does not play well with non-premium brand bluetooth. Yes, it's great for iPhone. But, for Android and PCs with bluetooth, audio quality may stutter, and connectivity may suddenly fail.Really, the OontZ Angle 3 is meant to be used with premium equipment. I would have eliminated the audio in aux port, and simply required the latest bluetooth without any version compatibility fallback. For those of us who want to use an Oontz in a desktop PC environment, we should look elsewhere.

It isn't the loudest speaker in the world, I tried to hear it over my snowmobile and it wasn't happening but I wasn't expecting to be able to either. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's annoying to tell whether or not it is on or off making Bluetooth connection a hair frustrating. Sometimes it makes a on noise sometimes it doesn't. But other than that it is a great little speaker for in the woods, working on a car, or at work.

The buttons are soft and easy to push and locate. It also has a decent speaker phone. The small size and flexibility (horizontal or vertical) make it easy to set anywhere as I move around. Since the the volume between the speaker and the phone are independent there is a great deal more flexibility with volume. It can be very loud when I’m gardening. And very quiet when I’m falling asleep. The sleep timer also comes in very handy. After the timer turns off my audiobook, the speaker turns  off after 15 minutes of no activity. Awesome!  It’s very comfortable to carry around. I also love that it’s Bluetooth connection signal is quiet and pleasant. The water resistance is also very handy if I need to touch it while doing the dishes.

I should have followed the adage of ""if it's too good to be true, it probably isn't"". In this case, the reviews are not close to reality.I purchased this speaker hoping to save a few bucks over the cost of another speaker like the Wonderboom speaker another member of our family has.  I was immediately disappointed in this OontZ Angle 3 for two reasons.  Most importantly, the sound produced by the speaker is no better than the sound produced by my I phone 8.  There is very little base sound and ""tinny"" overall sound is VERY disappointing. I don't consider myself a sound aficionado, nor do I consider myself a speaker snob; I just want a good full sound from a speaker.  Also, this speaker's volume is only able to be controlled by the phone so if the phone is not immediately available, there is no way to lower, or increase, the volume.Save yourself don't waste your hard earned money on this lame excuse for a bluetooth speaker.

Have tried everything:Full chargePair bluetoothUnpair/delete & re-pairUse jack wire instead of BTMove devices closer togetherMove devices farther apartHigh buzzing noise is present with or without audio playing .The first 2 we bought were okay but the third is a bummer.Not gonna buy anymore of these speakers.:(Splash resistant,  triangle design is perfect: set it on a shelf, scaffold,  backpack, in your car.  Won't roll around won't tip over, and has rubber no-slip ends. Form & feel is googd.

Maybe for some a few years is enough but being from the old school I don't throw things out as soon as a new model comes out.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought the speaker last June as I just started shopping online. I noticed a problem as I charged the speaker - the connection between the cord and the speaker was very loose, basically it cannot stay connected, I had to use something (e.g. a pillow or a book)  to hold it to stabilize it to charge it. As showed on the picture, the cord cannot stay straight, it tilts down.Since I wasn't an experience online shopper at the time, I just decided to continue using it that way. Until this Thursday, it cannot be turnned on completely.I liked the quality of the sound, that's why I gave two stars instead of one, but no matter how much I loved the sound, I'll have to shop another one after only one year of using it along all the troubles I had during this time.Was it only my bad luck? I rely on customer reviews heavily so I decided to share my experience here. It is a real feedback from a real person, not from a competitor who trying to trush this product.

Or have one that does those things last longer than 2 months. So far this one is not only Loud and clear enough to hear over the truck but it STILL works  going on 6 months! I know that doesn't seem terribly long but I swear in this day and age where they cheep out on materials so things won't last, It  is nice to find something as rugged (Has been dropped far and thrown pretty good, surrounded in  dust...) and great quality as it actually claims. Would definitely buy again! Actually I actually came on to get myself one for around the farm! So yeah we would recommend.  :)

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, what's not to like about this little, powerful, tuff son-of a-gun speaker??? I waited a long time to review this little dynamo and I just get more and more impressed with this wee guy!!! I live in the country and carry this speaker everywhere with Alexa pouring out tune after tune. Probably drives my neighbors (multiple acres away) with the extreme quality these little speakers (there are two) pour out!! I have dropped it more times than I can count, my dog has run off with it and shook it (all the while playing George Strait at top volume), then thankfully brought it back. Stuck in the window when it's raining, it never gives up-cat has swatted it around and I even take it into a humid post-shower bathroom. Alright, I never intended to abuse it, but it's my only music speaker, but not sadly, this little thing rocks! The battery stays charged for days if you turn it off at night and even if you don't and it dies-just plug it into the charger and it play immediately-and charges at the same time. I have plugged it into my laptop for MP3 tunes....phenomenal. I keep thinking, I should get another one, but this little thing plays so well, I have to turn it down just to realize someone has come over to visit! Oh, don't have Bluetooth so couldn't comment on that. Just the best most mobile-throw it in your pocket on the way outside- speaker.***Update: I guess it's Murphy's Law but I just wrote this review last night and this morning it will not work with Alexa (the volume will not increase). Thought it was Alexa, but tried it on the laptop and it worked for a few minutes then turned itself off. It is fully charged but will not stay on and will not play more than a whisper on Alexa....figures, only eight months old. Thought this was the exception. Bringing it back to only four stars from five. Sorry everyone.

But, my time listening has come down over the years, and my son asked if he could have it. Now I've retired, and have more free time.

I turned it on and paired it to my phone, which took literally 3 seconds, and it started to play.  Ive had lots of Bluetooth speakers and none connected as painlessly as this one - it just worked.2.  The sound coming out of this device is impressive.  It’s about the size of a soda can, prism shaped with eased edges (no pointy corners).  The lows are better than you’d expect, and mids are good.  I’d prefer crisper highs but overall the sound is better than the Bose which costs 3 Xs as much, is 50% bigger, and is difficult to connect to my phone.  It’s as good as the boom 3 which costs 6 Xs what I paid for this one.3.  It’s pretty loud.  You’d expect a tiny speaker to max out long before this does.  There is a little distortion when it’s cranked all the way up, but not at all what you’d expect from these little speakers pushed betond their sweet spot.For 1/4 of $100, this little guy is amazing so far.

Cure: purchased a Bluetooth transmitter for my SONY TV and used my Bluetooth earbuds. Problem ... had to take earbuds out to talk and wife couldn't hear. Purchased this speaker as a substitute. It's next to us and voice from streamed media is much clearer, especially when competing with loud background music (eg. Star Trek Discovery) or low spoken dialog (eg. Handmaiden's Tale). It's been a week. So far, so good.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had several of these small BT speakers.  Some are simply trash, others are better.  My expectations for such a small package are not very high.  This one has changed my view!I like the design.  The triangular shape gets the speakers aimed up away from the surface it is sitting on.  The corners are protected and the it has soft feet to keep it where you place it.The sound quality is pretty amazing for such a small speaker.  It is not going to rattle the windows with huge bass but has enough bass to keep the sound from being thin and tinny.  The mids and highs are acceptable, given the price point.  I was pretty impressed with the amount of noise this little speaker makes.  Again, for the money invested, it does a good job.The most impressive part of the Oontz, for me, is the battery life.  I have played this thing for more than 9 hours on a single charge with no issue.

We have a cruddy store bought speaker we use nightly for thunderstorm sounds from Youtube and the quality difference is painful.  I love everything about this speaker!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a solid little Bluetooth speaker, the only negative for me is that I always carry it in my backpack, and it constantly turns on by itself. In other words if the power button just barely bumps into anything it turns on. I constantly have to open my backpack and dig it out (which is hard to do because my backpack is pure black, and I can't see the speaker against the pure black) and turn it off multiple times a day because I hear it turn on. The volume level is ok, and certainly a big improvement over an iPhone or ipad's volume limit, but if you want something really loud, this isn't the unit for you. For that you might need a BTS that plugs in. Battery life is actually pretty good if you only use it on occasion like I do. I can go a week or two without recharging it (but I only use it for a few minutes here and there, I use it primarily as part of my work, not for recreational listening).

The instructions that come with this are very clear and easy to understand. The speaker does everything the instructions say it will do when you pair it to whatever device you were going to use it with. I use it in the bathroom while taking a shower but I don't let it get wet. I can hear it just fine from the bathroom sink even with the shower running! I added a small piece of velcro to the bottom so that I can move it around in my car, which doesn't have speakers, to prevent the Sun from beating down on it during the 100-plus degree days we've been having over here in the east. All that is to say, I don't bully it,so I don't know for sure how well it will do if you bully it. For $30 bucks it can't be beat.Let me also give a shout out to the excellent customer service by Cambridge sound.

It was very annoying and not acceptable. But then these problems disappear and even tho it sometimes disconnect, t connects back by itself (and it's very rare and for a minute or so). Otherwise, I'm listening on my comp speakers, switch this speaker on and it almost seamlessly connects to it and switch the sound from comp speakers to this. The comp even keeps volume levels different form it's own speakers and this speaker. So the overall volume actually stays the same during this switch.So overall, I'm pretty happy with it.

One out of three is not great.Build quality is pretty good.  Sound quality is, meh, average, not earth shattering but then for the price it is rather over sold.  Let's not pretend it's anything but sub-par sound.However, the reliability of the unit is not good.  I am on my second one now and it suffers the same issue the first one did and others seem to of complained about.  Randomly, the unit will cause the sound stream to pause, restart itself and now you have to manually start the stream again.  No other Bluetooth Audio device I've owned has ever exhibited this problem and shouldn't.  Since this second one has the same problem (I tried both my iPad, iPhone and PC Laptop, all same problem) I will now return it and find another brand that doesn't over hype itself then fall very short.

I was miffed that this thing only has a year-long lifespan, because it seems wasteful that it becomes trash within a year. When I think about it, though, a $24 speaker that lasts a year is only $2/month. But their customer service was good, they responded quickly, and the replacement arrived quickly.The battery life is great at first, but within about nine months, it would only play about 3 hours on a full charge.Features I wish this thing had? A skip feature, so you could skip to the next song. A mute feature, since the ""pause"" button doesn't work with streaming video. Louder volume.I would say that the sound quality is okay - it's hard to hear quiet podcasts over the sound of my shower, even on the highest volume. If you need a speaker loud enough to blast at a party, this isn't the speaker for you. But if you just want to listen to music in your quiet house, and you're on a budget, this is a totally acceptable speaker.I probably wouldn't buy this speaker again. It is aesthetically pleasing, but light on features. The case is physically durable, but the components will not last.

It failed a month or so later. The company immediately sent out a replacement. Now, after a similar time frame, the device has failed again. It has failed in the precise way as the first. Despite having a great sound, good battery time, good design...the company managed to spec crap when it came to the speaker's USB port. The connection between the male charging cord and female charging port is what has failed each time and in the precise same manner.I did not bother filing a warranty claim with the company since I'd just get another speaker that would fail in a month or two. I cannot emphasize how unfortunate the company's manufacturing decisions are regarding the USB connection. The speaker is excellent. If the company spent maybe two and a half cents more per speaker for a better USB mechanical connection, the product would indeed be as good as they stipulate vs. (currently) a waste of one's money.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this speaker first for the price and ratings. It helped prove that having a bluetooth speaker next to my chair in the living room made a huge improvement in my television viewing (as my audiologist had suggested). There was some latency though of about a half-second, so I did some homework about bluetooth transmitters, speakers and latency. First step was to swap out the transmitter connected to the television; it had aptX but hung behind the television with a short cord. Then I purchased the Shenen bluetooth 4.2 speaker and the Deripus bluetooth 4.2 speaker. Never got any sound from the Deripus other than the speaker telling me it was paired. The Shenen crackled so often with intermittent communications in the first hour that it was obviously not a long term solution (even for the night). So I hooked up the Cambridge OontZ. It paired easily, and the lag with the new transmitter is barely noticeable but acceptable. Very happy with the volume controls  (lowest volume on Shenen was way too loud for me and the rest of the family), and it has the bass I need (also missing from the Shenen).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"With Cambridge SoundWorks you are always guaranteed excellent quality.  I have been using their products for decades and still have a big pair of home theater speakers that are running strong after 15 years.  This very little guy of a speaker is very impressive.  It is so tiny and obviously very easy to carry anywhere.  Of all the bluetooth speakers I have tried this was the most portable.  The ease of the bluetooth connection was a mere few seconds and it would immediately find its last source and be ready to play.  The sound quality at lower to mid levels is awesome with crystal clear clarity added with just the right amount of bass.  For me the sound did get somewhat muddled at the higher volumes.  The speaker is indeed loud but I found the clarity slightly sacrificed.  I play my speakers on the higher end in my apartment and have found others to provide better sound quality with the highs.  I am not sure if outside the highs may indeed work much better with this speaker.The biggest plus here with this speaker is ease of connection and its quality in that it is solidly built and durable while holding a constant connection.  It never breaks up in the slightest.  I also think when it comes to sound quality it is honestly a matter of preference.  Everyone plays different types and styles of music, wants different highlights in their music.  Some want more bass while some want an enhancement of vocals or treble.  This speaker is an amazing value with impressive built quality.  I can highly recommend it.

When using as a speakerphone, I can leave my phone in my office and carry the speaker anywhere in the house with no interference or disruption. It's water resistant, so it is great to use in the shower. The controls are well placed and give you the ability to pause, skip, and of course adjust the volume. When switching between devices, you don't have to use the device it's currently connected to in order to disconnect. Just press the bluetooth button to disconnect and then connect on your other device. Even outdoors, it has powerful sound. Excellent product.

The Plus has crystal clear sound and good bass. I really enjoyed the Plus, but where the Plus needed some improvement was with its volume and bass.The new OontZ Angle3 significantly increases the volume and bass, but more importantly it retains and improves upon the crisp and crystal clear sound of its predecessor, plus it adds an ingenious bass design.

It also retains the angular design of its predecessor, but now has a silicone rubber type finish on both ends of the speaker. It's still void of any sharp edges. It's a great looking speaker, with a unique design. I like this Angle3 design better than the Plus.It's significantly louder than the Plus and has nice bass, for a unit that's this small. If you enjoy music that has some bass, this unit should meet your needs and be truthful, the sound that comes out of this speaker is mind boggling to me and the size of this speaker belies that fact!The passive radiator, which produces the bass in the Angle3 and most Bluetooth speakers, is located on the bottom of the unit. If you place it bottom down, the bass effect is more pronounced. If you want a little less bass, you'll stand it on end. When it's bottom down, the bass has a nice little thump. I believe this was done by design and it's an ingenious feature.Be careful where you place the speaker bottom down, because it does want to move when playing music with bass. The speaker has pads on the bottom, but they work better on very smooth and glass surfaces.You can hear that Cambridge Soundworks spent the majority of its time improving and refining the sound of the Angle3. That focus on improving acoustics shows up big time in this tiny, but crystal clear and loud speaker.There's no distortion at max volume. The speaker has 10+ watts of peak power. It's now loud enough to fill up your backyard party with clear, great sounding music. My wife heard me playing music upstairs and she was in the garage. It's plenty loud!All my music testing was done using Spotify. Speaker was set to full volume and iOS volume was set two clicks from max, for most of my testing. I also tested both settings set to max.Bluetooth connectivity is super easy. It connects from one device to another effortlessly. I found you don't have to press a button on the speaker to pair it with a different device. I like intuitive functions and this one fits the bill. It also has a speakerphone function. You can play and pause your tracks from the device as well.The OontZ Angle3 doesn't have all the options others have. You don't get NFC support, a micro SD card slot or the ability to skip tracks using the speaker controls. There are other Bluetooth speakers that have these options, but if you value how well your music sounds over a myriad of options, this beautiful sounding speaker is for you.The Angle3 has an IPX5 certification, which makes it splash proof and dust proof. Great for the shower and other wet environments. Don't be afraid to shower with it or have it out in the rain. It can't be submerged in water with this IPX rating.Battery life is about 7 hours, at 60% volume. It will be less at higher volumes. This is definitely less than the Plus unit, which does 12-15 hours of use. You have to take into account that the battery is driving much more sound and requires that extra battery power. I personally like the trade off and all that's required is to charge the unit a bit more frequently. A battery status symbol shows up in my iOS devices.If you're like me and aren't interested in the all the above mentioned options, that you may never use and just want a beautiful sounding speaker that's main focus is perfecting and delivering crystal clear sound, than this speaker is an excellent option to consider.To me, the OontZ Angle3 has no real negatives to mention. You could quibble about having more features, but I really don't consider that a negative. I'd rather have a great sounding speaker, over more features. In my opinion, this is a great Bluetooth speaker for the price.The OontZ Angle3 is a very solid speaker, that now has outstanding volume and good bass. It retains and actually improves upon the crisp highs and strong mids of its predecessor. I like that Cambridge Soundworks is actually focusing on sound quality and not loading up on tons of features.I can highly recommend the OontZ Angle3.Thank you for reading my review.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a bit smaller than what I expected, but it's a good personal speaker for at home use. The sound quality is really good for the price point but the volume could be louder. While it's a bit too quiet to really use as a ""party"" speaker, it's perfect for use around the house, shower, or with a few friends, and it probably wont upset the neighbors. Speaking of the shower, a feature that I really enjoy is that it's water resistant. I wouldn't take it in the shower with me, but it holds up nicely against steam or counter-top spills. It also seems to have better bass than most of the smaller bluetooth speakers that I've used. The wifi range is great, I'd say it can reliably reach about 100 ft, but I've not really had the opportunity to really test it's limits. I literally use this daily lol

Sounded good.The next day, I turned it on, buzz and shut off. After more than half a dozen times, it turned on. It no longer paired. Looked up tips online. Did a ""Forget this Device"", restarted my iPhone, tried the ""reset speaker"" (didn't feel a microswitch in there, though)... all to no avail.You shouldn't have to do gymnastics every time you want to turn on the speaker and play something.Maybe I have the 1 in 100 bad one... Returned. Not going to get another. I just don't have time to keep shipping stuff back.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little speaker has some amazing sound at this price point.I was expecting half as much sound from this thing and was very surprised as to how well it performed with bass heavy music (rap stations) to acoustics (70s rock, Yes, Classical guitar).+ At full volume, across a 15 x 15 room, it's quite distractingly loud and you'll have to talk loud to talk over the speaker.+ Battery life seems great so far, 2 charges in and it's lasted me several weeks or work out sessions and continue rocking out in the shower after.+ Bass is decent  on its own indoors. on certain surfaces, at the right angles, you can enhance the deepness of the bass. (In the bathroom, if I put one side up on the lip of the sink, the bass effect through the sink cabinet is deeper and fuller sounding)+ Bass is OK outdoors, but its not going to sound as rich as indoors.+ Can be used while charging.- not a whole lot of control options directly on the speakerI had a 20 year old Cambridge Sound Works PC speaker set that is no longer made that, sadly, finally stopped working. It was crystal clear and had excellent bass and while not as powerful bass as my new replacement speaker system, was definitely a richer, fuller sound rivaling my home theater.  I didn't realize/notice that the OontZ Angle 3 was also made by CSW until after i'd received it.  The brand holds up its name in quality, and at 24 bucks I was really surprised what it delivered.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"sound is great, loud, splash proof, and everything else the good reviews say are for the most part all true. But maybe I got a bad apple, so it won't get 1-star because I do believe I could be on the small percentage of casualties.I've had this speaker for about 6 months, use it about 1-4 times a month, and it's never gotten wet.One day it just quit taking/holding a charge. Plug it in and it shows charging, after a few hours of being plugged in it still wont turn on. Being out of warranty I went ahead and broke it down and starting testing the battery on my bench and determined the battery cell was just bad. Not the PCB that's wrapped up inside the skin of the battery (probably controls over charging, over heating, and whatnot) but the cell itself just up and quit.Luckily it was a 18650 size 3v battery which are available with leads and controllers already.This is the other annoying part and why it gets 2 stars. it's only the cheapest, lowest capacity 18650 around. 2000 mAh and NiMh. In today's world, why not something bigger or maybe even lithium? I would pay the extra $4 in cost difference in the end for a unit that could advertise higher quality components.So I scooped up a new cheap battery, a 4000 mAh 18650 with leads and board. Wired it up and now I've got twice the usable play time.If it would have lasted a whole year I would have probably considered it a 3-4 star unit. But 6 months of light use just doesn't cut it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound quality is ok at best. Almost no bass at all. Sound is flooded by mids and highs. The only thing this speaker has going for it is it plays clear at loud volume levels. Battery was never great. It would last 4 to 6 hours at best. After 1 month of use, battery appears to no longer hold a charge forcing me to leave it plugged in. After 3 months, it began to loose bluetooth connectivity and speaker would just power off making me have to get up and turn speaker back on and reconnect. Disclaimer: this was put thru heavy use. It was used as a night speaker playing music for 8 hours every night.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a bit leery about ordering this speaker because of some of the feedback.I found the sound quality to be mind blowing for the price.  Mind you, it's not a $1,000 stereo. It's a ~$25 bluetooth speaker so that must be considered.The bluetooh connectivity is OK. There is some delay that's a little annoying on the phone and the bluetooth loses connection if not in use for a period of time. I actually bought this so that I could use it with my iPhone to answer calls while sitting on the sofa. I'm a bit disappointed in that because I have to reconnect the bluetooth when someone calls, if it hasn't been in use for awhile. I guess that's understandable because if it were ""ON"" all the time, the battery wouldn't last long.Still....... for a $25???? Really? What does one expect? I had to give it 5 stars.................... so far.............. I'll edit this if anything changes.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I REALLY wanted to like this speaker but the fact that I constantly have to re-establish the Bluetooth connection with my iPhone is a deal-breaker. It might play 1 or 2 songs but then the connection breaks and I have to stop what I am doing and reset it. I mean even when I leave my phone RIGHT next to it this happens.Unfortunately I can't return it as the return period just expired. I guess I should have tested it more and discovered this flaw earlier.UPDATE: it is not the battery as the issue persists even when plugged in. It also drops with ANY device (not just my phone). I have tried contact Cambridge via Amazon, email and their website but haven’t received a response from any channel.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My built-in Lenovo laptop ""speakers"" were almost inaudible on many websites. This speaker solved that problem. I had a full-size woofer/tweeters for decades, but it finally quit on me.This tiny, 6"" long, inexpensive one-piece (INCLUDING 4"" WOOFER) gives great sound, though of course true stereo ambiance is lacking. But for under $20, who cares ? Bluetooth connectivity was a snap, and battery life is good. Charging via micro-USB. Phone plug connectivity included. My old speakers were from Cambridge, and these were too, though the ad doesn't mention it - a mistake.

It worked out for neither. On the PC end, there's no way to control the volume of the device from the computer (unlike every $10 computer speaker ever made), and worse, you must manually turn the device on EVERY time you use it.The sound quality is pretty good for its size and category.This device does not work with Amazon Echo Dot. It advertises this functionality but it does not work, at least with regard to Bluetooth communication.

This little guy really delivered!It has impressive sound quality for a $30 speaker. It's not perfect (there's a mild shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh sound in the background of everything; it's also a little heavy on the treble), but it works just fine for casual listening.So far, I haven't gotten it too wet, and it seems to be splashproof. Not submersible, though - the bottom is open to let the bass out, so I imagine it wouldn't be good to sink it in any water.A really big plus for me was how nice the quick start guide was! I was expecting a poorly translated, mildly confusing sheet of paper, but it's several pages and in clear, correct English. Yay!I think my favorite feature, though, is that you can skip songs using the volume buttons...so nice!Now my laptop waits in my bedroom and I don't freak out. 5/5!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I read all the reviews that gave this speaker five stars. I figured it couldn't be that good for the relative price point, but I use a speaker in the shower an listen to the morning news.I use it to stream from my Alexa dot, and it hooks up easily and without a problem.The blue tooth is flawless and good for at least 20 feet.The sound is great. Clear for the voices and news. Music sounds good. For a small speaker, great quality and volume.Now, the only negative.It is re-chargeable and turns off after 5 minutes of no use if no connection. EXCEPT, it does NOT turn off when hooked up to Alexa. The instructions clearly state that the auto turnoff does not work with the Alexa.So, if using it with the Dot or Alexa system, you have to turn it off manually after use. Or, the speaker will stay on until the battery dies.Not a big deal, It does immediately hook up with Alexa through blue tooth when turned on. But, it would be nice if they could fix that issue.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"PROS1.  Sound is fairly loud, clear and decent for for a small portable Bluetooth speaker.  I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because it is better than a lot of bluetooth speakers under $50 that I have seen or purchased in the past.2. Easy to connect and excellent bluetooth portability.3.  Battery life is decent, around 10 hours or so of listening pleasure.4.  Inexpensive portable Bluetooth speaker!CONS1. Serious BASS lovers, don't even bother.  Not too heavy on the BASS which can be upsetting at times, but it is louder than expected.  I had to purchase a small bluetooth amp for louder and deeper BASS.2.  Battery takes something like 5 or so hours to fully charge.other thoughts:Moving around to different surfaces and environments effects the sound quality and bass.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"The sounds this little puppy puts out is quite amazing. I am a serious audiophile, but this unit outperforms all expectations for something this size, leave alone something this price. At top volume setting it's literally too loud for me, in a full size bathroom, even with my ears damaged from shooting and loud music. At reasonable listening volumes, the sound is clean and distortion free, and you know it's OK, because you enjoy your favourite music. This is no tinny sound, it's decently full spectrum.Don't expect huge bass, but the hint of bass drum, bass guitar, and low freq synth is all there.Could you get more bass from a wireless speaker? Yes. But this is a unit you'll easily decide to carry each and every time in your backpack, whereas the larger Bose or Sonos are not options for easily portable.Oh, and I used this thing in the shower, it got sprinkles of water, but no change in sound performance. It says it is water and weather safe.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"Well my below review is still completely true, however after 3 and a half months the speaker can no longer hold a charge, or the charger cable has stopped working. It will only play for about 5 seconds before shutting off. This is a huge bummer since I like this speaker so much. I mostly leave the speaker in one place too, it hasn't been jostled about at all. Changing rating from 5 stars to 1 as this is the auxiliary speaker with the shortest life span I have experienced yet. Fail :(.  Original review:  WOW!!!!! So impressed. The internal speakers in my Mac laptop are blown & I've been using various external speakers for the last couple years, most of them lasting roughly 6 months and exhibiting many performance issues along the way. Not this little speaker!! So far anyway. I am seriously so impressed with the sound quality, volume level, ease of use/pairing/charging. Plus it's kinda cute, the shape is structurally smart (resistant to tipping over) and it has great little non-skid feet that really keep it in place. Only it's longevity remains to be seen...

4.0 out of 5 stars,"PROS:This speaker works well enough when connected to my phone via bluetooth or the included audio cable. It is louder than I expected it to be while connected to my phone (galaxy s8).CONS:The volume is NOT great when I cast my screen and audio to a monitor, then run the audio to the speaker from the monitor. I'm not sure why there would be a difference between my phone and the monitor's volume projections. There must be some disconnect with the monitor and speaker's compatibility. I don't have a newer monitor to try it on, but it's possible that my (several year old) monitor doesn't work great with this technology.The speaker great for the price, and really does work perfectly when connected with my phone. I just wish it was more universal with older devices/monitors (if that is indeed the problem). I like to watch things while I cook, and thought I could use this speaker in combination with the monitor, but the volume is too low to be able to heard clearly over the various sounds of cooking.

I also needed to replace my old Bluetooth speaker that my wife accidentally dropped into the pool. I'm completely disappointed in this product. The sound quality is nowhere near what the raving 5 star writers would lead you to believe. I wasn't expecting professional quality sound, but I was expecting better than what I got. The speaker sounds exactly like you would expect a small cheap speaker to sound like: small and cheap.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update - I have owned this speaker for two years now. It still sounds great.  I am still amazed at the sound that comes from this compact speaker.If you are wondering if the reviews are to good to be true STOP WORRYING and buy this speaker before Cambridge SoundWorks realizes they priced it too low.I was trying to find a new Bluetooth speaker for my wife as a birthday gift. The Logitec that we owned for several years just didn't sound like it used to. In addition to the Bluedio BS-3 I also purchased the Cabridge SoudWorks OontZ Angle 3, and the UE Roll (1st Generation). If you are wondering, the Cambridge SoundWorks had the best sound in my opinion regardless of price.When we received all three speakers my wife insisted I participate in a blind listening test. I am a cheap skate and she was convinced I would favor the cheaper speaker (she did not know the prices when we listened to them). We found an article online with song recommendations for testing speakers and headphones. We listened to Caribbean Blue by Enya (not a fan but a good song to test the speakers), Brass Monkey by Beasty Boys, and Unfinished Sympathy by Massive Attack. I also added Falling Slowly from the Once soundtrack as it has good female and male vocals in the same song, as well as acoustic guitar.ResultsBluedio BS-3 - This speaker was easily identified as the 3rd Place speaker. While it sounded fine there was not a single song I listened to where it stood out. The one area where I felt this speaker excelled was in volume. You could leave this speaker on the kitchen counter and hear it clearly in the living room 30 feet away. The only negative was a constant soft static sound in the back ground. If I had not been comparing side by side I might not have noticed it. Had this speaker been less expensive than the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angel 3 I might have considered it.UE Roll (1st Generation) - The UE Roll was a very good speaker and definitely a good value at $67. My wife and I did not share our opinions with each other as we progressed through the listening test. The amazing thing was that we both had identical thoughts about all three speakers. Our first impression was that the UE Roll had the best sound. However when we narrowed it down to the a head to head contest with the Oonz Angle 3 we realized it had very different sound from the other speakers. The only way I can describe it is that the Roll sounds like it is under a thin lid. There is a slightly muffled echo aspect to the sound. The more I listened, the more I noticed, and I did not like it. Again had I purchased this speaker on its own I would have liked it just fine. It is also possible mine was a one off for UE.Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3 - When I told my wife that this speaker was only $30 she didn't believe me.Seriously how is this speaker $30!!! She has a Bose speaker in her office at work. This speaker is no where near as good as the Bose, but my wife appreciates good sound. The Oontz Angle 3 sounds great. The funny thing is that I almost eliminated it from consideration listening to Brass Monkey because I thought it had a harsh sound to it. I later realized that it was just the jarring differences of the UE Roll. The Roll's slightly muffled sound made the Angle 3 sound harsh in comparison.If you are looking for a Bluetooth speaker under $100 the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3 is a great choice. The best part is that it is only $30!!!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really happy with this speaker overall. I bought it primarily based on price and the water resistance rating. This is for use outdoors, and I didn't want to kick myself if I accidentally left it outside overnight.Pros:- Great build quality. It feels really solid.- Volume is impressive for such a small speaker.- High range is very clear.- Bluetooth pairing is super fast, maybe takes 2 seconds at the most.Cons:- I was not impressed with the bass, as some other reviewers seem to have been. It's mostly non-existent.- Mid-range sounds a bit muddy at times.One minor personal gripe: I wish the micro-USB was a bit more recessed under the rubber seal. I use cables with interchangeable, magnetic tips so I can charge everything with the same cable. Unfortunately, I can't put one of the micro-USB tips in the port because it would cause the cover to stay open. It's not a dealbreaker, and most people probably won't care.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wasn't expecting too much for the price point here but it definitely exceeded. The angle is pretty en-genius. I like to point my smaller bluetooth speakers toward the wall or any flat surface because the sound seems to bounce back louder. I normally have to place something under the front of a speaker to give it an upward angle to maximize the affect. This speaker already has the angle so this works particularly well. Most speakers I have bought in the past that have good bass seems to come at the cost of a decent midrange sound. This speaker has plenty have bass and seems balanced with treble and mid as well. Which is great if you ever listen to anything other than rap. Doesnt get distorted at max volume either. I really liked the doss touch wirless v4.0 bluetooth speaker and got on to purchase another but after seeing the reviews on this one decided to give it a try. They are extremely close in sound quality but have to give the win to the OontZ angle because is smaller, so easier to travel with. It also seems a little bit less distorted at max volume than the doss. (the doss may have a tiny bit more bass but not much at all) Overall a great design and great sound at an unbeatable price.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Alright, so I got this during the Cyber Monday sale.I had some really nice speakers with old roommates, but they belonged to them (bummer). So when I moved into my own place, I didn't know how much I wanted to invest. I figured that I'd start small and go from there. I'm SO glad I did.This speaker is crazy powerful, but small. It turns off by itself if you're not using it, which is a huge plus because I constantly forget to turn stuff off (yikes). A full battery charge lasts four to five days, even if you are using it 12 hours (about my usage). And it will tell you if it needs a charge by flashy a red light at you. It's not annoying or anything, but not subtle either.The reasons I took a star off: the aux cord that came with it will absolutely break (it's short anyways) plus the blutooth capabilities are meh.I had actually bought an extra auxiliary cord because I knew I would want a much longer cord, which I did. Ended up being a wise choice when the one that came with the speaker broke. And even if my phone is within a foot of it, the blutooth cuts out. Which sucks, but isn't a real issue for me.Tldr; Besides a couple of forgivable flaws, totally worth it.

My daughter has basically claimed this thing, and I may need to order another one. It was left outside overnight in a very light sprinkle of rain (more like a slight misting) and woke up to dew on the ground. The amount of moisture, which wasn’t much, had no effect on it. I highly recommend this. It has a long lasting battery, excellent sound, great volume and a better value than comparable speakers costing more. I have tried Altec Lansing, Bose and Anker, and I thought this one sounded much better.  Although, the Anker was a close competition.  I was steered away from that one because of connectivity and battery life issues from the one I tested.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Why some might think it has crappy sound, and how to fix it (Not an issue with the speaker!)...The speaker has two modes... phone calls or music. If the device you are connecting to uses its ""Mic"", it will use the ""Hands Free"" Bluetooth mode. The quality of the ""Hands Free"" Bluetooth mode is sub-par. Good for phone calls, sucky for music. If the device you connect it to recognizes it as an audio device, the audio quality is WAY better, I mean night and day, but has no Mic functionality. I use it as an audio device, and I do not use its Mic functionality. If you use it with a computer, you may have to disable the hands free functionality in the Control panel > Sound (See images) to get good audio from it and to use it as a speaker. So basically it depends how the device you connect it to handles it. My Pixel 2 sees it as an audio device, and I get great quality when listening to music, then it switches over to ""Hands Free"" mode and it sounds like any other hands free Bluetooth speaker...I don't ever leave reviews hardly, but this guy is worth it. For a speaker of it's size it is GREAT. Honestly I have been extremely impressed with its performance, it really sounds rich. It has a full range sound. It is not going to have tons of bass (No small speaker does because of physical characteristics) but if you are looking for a well blended sound this guys is perfect! For its size it has a fair amount of base (As much as a small speaker can). Its mids, highs, and lows, all complement and one does not dominate the other. In addition I am 1/2 deaf, and this thing can crank. Don't get me wrong it is still a small speaker, so you aren't going to get surround sound quality, but it goes loud enough that it might even be considered uncomfortably loud (To a 1/2 deaf person).I use it as a computer speaker at night, because I can place it next to my bed so I can watch movies as I fall asleep and not bother people in the other rooms, and don't have to worry about wearing headphones.It has fairly big volume adjustments on its side, so it is easy to adjust the volume or turn the volume down in the middle of the night. I use a 4.2 pluggable USB adapter on the computer, and I am able to go into other rooms close to the computer. But it will cut out any further than that. It does sometimes struggle in rooms next to the computer, but usually you can find a spot where it works just fine.I can actually carry it into the bathroom (Very close by, only one room over) and listen to audio on my computer while I take a shower... BUT it is not going to give you any significant left/right channel, it comes out more of a mono speaker.It will cut out if you get too far away from the computer, so it def won't go through the whole house, but into a room over it should do decent. (With that USB Bluetooth 4.2 Pluggable adapter).

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second Oontz I bought (the first one being the Oontz plus, the older and bigger version). This speaker worked well initially, although I found the sound is not as crisp as the bigger version. About one month later, the plastic strip that covers the power button and USB port fell off. It made it looks kind of ugly. Aside from that, it made powering on/off the speaker very annoying because it relies you to press the plastic strip to power on/off it. Without the plastic strip, you have to use a small pin to push the little button inside a hole to turn on/off it.Worse thing, now the speaker's battery is completely dead. No matter how long you charge it through USB port, it does not have any power. Essentially, it is a dead speaker. I kind of noticed that the speaker's play time lasted shorter and shorter. But I did not really pay attention as I though I did not charge long enough. Now it is completely dead and useless.It is a very bad experience with this speaker and I would not recommend buying it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I needed a small blue tooth speaker because the Echo Dot sound quality just wasn't cutting it and i would like to add music to whatever room I am working in that may not have a device. I have an Echo Dot 2nd and 3rd gen. The 2nd gen is tinny and the 3rd way too bass centric and boomy, but still better than this speaker. The sound quality doesn't blow me away, in fact, it is pretty bad. Not enough bass and not much of an improvement over my Echo Dot Mini 2nd Gen. Wow, this is so disappointing. The speaker paired easily with my phone and laptop, but had an issue pairing with the Alexa app via blue tooth. The controls are a pain to see in low light. As long as you keep your expectations super low you will be happy.----Update-----Lost another star after buying the Doss Touch speaker for $4 more. The Doss has MUCH better sound quality and paired to Echo Dot instantly. The Oontz seems to be having difficulties with Alexa. Probably going to return this and buy the upgraded version of the Doss 20W because I am much more impressed with that speaker as a whole. The sound quality on the Doss is more balanced and it has True Wireless Stereo so both can be used simultaneously. At first it was about being an upgrade to the Echo Dot sound quality, but now it's about better sound with every device. I was never happy with the sound on the Oontz to begin with and now it's completely unacceptable after trying a much better speaker within the same price range.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery in my ancient Bose Soundlink Mini II will no longer hold a charge so it was time to buy a really expensive new battery or just replace the speaker.  I bought the Oontz Angle 3 because of the ""rich bass"" and ""crystal clear stereo sound"" hype, the overwhelming number of excellent reviews, the small footprint and the crazy low price.The Angle 3 arrived fully charged so I plugged it into a music source (my desktop computer) and fired up some tunes.  ""Rich bass?""  Puhleez.  The sound was harsh, tinny and decidedly bass-free.  And if there was any ""crystal clear stereo"" separation going on it completely escaped me.  I actually grabbed the instructions to find out if I needed to enable something, download the latest drivers, anything...this couldn't be the same product.In retrospect I guess I wanted something for next to nothing and I got what I paid for.  This Oontz will get loud and presumably run off battery for a long time, as well as hold a BlueTooth connection over a long distance.  And the price is hard to beat.  If that's what you're shopping for this may work for you.  I don't care about any of that; I want a very compact speaker system replacement for my desktop PC that packs a punch.  This is not that item.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I took this on vacation with a big group of friends and it got a ton of use.  It went to the beach with us, it was out on the deck, etc. constantly.  I used it myself, let my friends connect to it and so on.Connection - easy.  Paired it to probably 5 different phones over the course of the week and nobody had any trouble hooking up to it, and it seemed to keep a solid connection even when there was a good distance between the phone and the speaker.  There is no security code and it shows up as Oontz Angle on your phone so it is obvious what it is.  It gives a chime to tell you it has successfully paired, so it is very easy to manage.  It will automatically pair to the last device connected to it if it finds it in range when you turn it on.Battery life - if you remember to charge it at the end of the day, it does not die.  Even with heavy use, we never had it die on us during the day.Sound Quality - It can get shockingly loud without distortion for such a little speaker.  Loud enough to fill even a big room.  Probably the best way to describe the sound quality is that it is appropriate for the intended use - out at the beach, on the deck, on a picnic, etc.  This thing isn't going to replace your home stereo, or even compete with much larger speaker systems that aren't meant to be portable or go outside.  But it more than gets by.  I tend to be fairly fussy about sound quality and yet I really didn't mind listening to this little thing for hours.  Yes, you cannot really fight physics when it comes to bass, it doesn't have separate tweeters, etc. but despite all that, the sound is still somehow not objectionable.  It is not going to blow you away with how great it sounds, but given how little it costs, how small it is, and the fact that it is waterproof, it is definitely punching a few notches above its weight.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this to replace a more expensive speaker which I use at work.  Having left the other one (JBL Flip 2) there it was eventually blown out by someone else, so I wanted to bring in something cheaper so I wouldn't care when it ends up getting ruined by inconsiderate people.The speaker is very light compared to the Flip 2.  The triangle design is much better in terms of preventing the unit from rolling off of whatever surface it's on.  It is overall not as wide as I imagined it would be.  It feels a little cheap but produces pretty good sound at a pretty good volume.  I find it a bit amusing that they would single out ""more bass"" right in the title of the item listing because that's the biggest difference I have heard so far between this and the Flip 2; the OontZ Angle does a passable job on bass heavy audio but it's nowhere near what you would get with something of higher quality like the Flip or a Bose Mini.Some of the design choices are a bit cheap feeling as well.  The indicator that the unit is charging is a slowly blinking red light.  The indicator that the unit is fully charged is that the light no longer blinks.  Good one, save the consumer a couple of dollars by just using the one LED.  You can't see this light from the front of the unit and it's not easy to see in general under 'normal' indoor lighting conditions unless you're looking right at it from a short distance.  The power button is also a source of small frustration -- I haven't figured out yet if I really need to press it two or three times to turn the unit off by design or if I'm just not pressing it hard enough or long enough.All the above negative criticism aside this is a fine product for the price.  I would say that if you've had or heard more expensive units from more established speaker brands, don't expect the sound quality of this to truly compare to them regardless of what the other reviews say.  This may be the best sound you'll get for under $30, I don't know for sure, but don't think you're cheating the system if you buy this -- if you're really into high quality spend some more money.Based on a couple of days of use in a few different situations I would buy this again.  I'd buy another one to leave up at the family cabin.  I'd consider it an easy gift purchase for a friend.  Being that it's so inexpensive I would consider it easily replaceable and not really mind if it got damaged or broken, however sad of a statement that is.Update: I DID end up buying another one of these recently to have around the house, again because it's just so good for the price.  I'm happy to say that the physical design issues I mentioned in my first review have been improved in a slight redesign.  The tactile response of the physical buttons is greatly improved.  The positioning of the status LEDs has also been improved.  I can't be positive but it feels like the sound is a little cleaner from the new unit, especially spoken word.  I'm completely happy with this now, I have nothing to nitpick.  Because of these improvements I happily updated my review from four to five stars.  You can't go wrong with this product.

You get what you pay for and this is no exception. This sounds like the speakers that come with those old-school alarm clocks. I literally laughed out when I played it and I am no way near being an audiophile.

Also playback would randomly speed up and slow down.  It just became unusable.  I never dropped it or abused it in any way.  Just set it on the shelf and connected via Bluetooth.  Its not my phone that is causing the problems because I can stream to my BOSE radio all day long with none of the issues I have mentioned here.  Using earbuds are likewise fine.  You definitely get what you pay for with this POS.  Its too late to return it, go I'll just bite the bullet and buy a JBL Bluetooth speaker (that I should have done in the first place).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had this speaker for about a year and a half, and in the beginning, it worked perfectly.  However, about 6 months ago, I noticed the Bluetooth stopped working, and it won't wirelessly pair with my ipod anymore.  But it's possible that's more the fault of my ipod (it's kind of old), and I can still use the AUX plug, so no harm no foul, I guess.  However, even when I pair it with my iphone, it sometimes doesn't work or requires me to fiddle with it in order to get to work.  Also, I had the speaker playing yesterday after having charged it overnight, and it kept cutting off for some reason.  Maybe it didn't charge sufficiently (I'm not sure why that would be the case), so I will try again today to use it, and hopefully the problem doesn't repeat itself.  Overall, I have enjoyed having it, the sound quality is pretty good (at least in my opinion), and I would buy it again even knowing that it might only work perfectly for about a year or so.Update: Speaker no longer holds a charge no matter how long you plug it in for. I was hoping this would last me longer than it actually did. Going to try a different brand next time.2nd Update: I contacted the company and they sent me a second speaker, free of charge.  It works perfectly.  Customer service for this company is really on point and is greatly appreciated.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"All the 5 star reviews on this speaker claiming that it has great sound quality are pretty deceiving for those looking for decent sound. This is a pretty poor speaker. At low volume it sounds hollow with no fullness to the sound. It's not much better at higher volumes as the treble is harsh and the mids start to blend together. It's very fatiguing to listen to for extended periods.It connects easily and I never had any pairing problems so that at least works well. This would be something that I might take on a camping trip and not worry about destroying. I would suggest doing some research and spending more on a better speaker. You will thank yourself in the end. I own several bluetooth speakers now that I spent quite a bit more on, but they were worth the extra money. However, if you just want something cheap to take on a trip and you don't care if it gets lost or stolen, then this might work out.

Not even in the same league).I A-B these two models, same songs, same settings, even used a db meter to make it legit, apples to apples kind of comparison.The DKnight has a warmer overall sound, great bass and decent mids and highs, unfortunately it seems like its been discontinued, I was going to order 3 more (I already have 3 of them for the fam), you can still find them on ebay but they jack you on the shipping. Now the OontZ was a real surprise, great Bass, has a lot more headroom as far as volume, it can get up to 90db +- (both can), very similar to the output on the DK .Though they're both rated at 10W I felt the OontZ was certainly louder. It might be a little on the bright side, and I dont mean that in a bad way, the Mids & HF really shined through, more so than the DKnight. On your cell or Ipod you can taylor the sound via equalizer so its not a game changer in any way. Both are really fantastic little Bluetooth speakers and anyone searching for  a good quality sound at a great price would be quite pleased with either one of them. I hope DKnight will continue the line but as is all too common it might be the end of the line at least for this model. Thankfully the OontZ is a winner and the cheaper price is a win win IMO.Get the While YOu Can!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical about this speaker at first but overall I'm pretty happy with it. It gets a lot louder than I expected and was even loud enough for my small wedding reception. The sound quality is fantastic as well. I only have 2 complaints about it.1. It takes an eternity to fully charge, and then the battery drains way faster than I'd like it to (about 3 hours of constant use).2. The Bluetooth distance is very limited. You basically have to keep your phone or music device right next to it or the music starts cutting out and sounding like a skipping CD.So if you want to use it unplugged, make sure you're charge it for a full day before you use it. And keep your audio device within ten feet or so if you want to avoid your music cutting out.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great little sound box. I've had mine for a little over a year now and I've used it for multiple functions. I initially bought it to use at a park for a memorial bbq since the city wanted a much larger deposit for ""amplified"" sound. Since a speaker doesn't count as amplified sound, I decided go that route. This little guy didn't disappoint and the sound carried well over 50 feet in either direction at half volume without sounding like it was coming out of a coffee can.I wouldn't say it's as great as the higher end sound systems you can buy with a seperate sub woofer, but it works very well for me and it is durable. It has been cranked up pretty loud without damage to the speaker. The Bluetooth connectivity is very quick and simple unless the battery is low. I've had this thing going for about 5 hours and never had to charge it. I've taken it camping and I use it on my patio pretty much every weekend. At low volume it sounds good, at high volume it sounds good. Although, I've found that depending on the surface it sits on, it can sound a little different. So I wouldn't recommend sitting it on hollow metal.It's very durable made and I've left it out in the sun and the rain without any issues or signs of sun damage. For the price, this is a very good buy. I didn't get it for free or anything so these are my genuine unbiased opinions.I think I only spent about 30 bucks on it. So I would highly recommend.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a FedEx driver, and wanted a bluetooth speaker that would let me listen to music and especially audiobooks as I drove around. I purchased the first generation OontZ speaker OontZ Angle Bluetooth Speaker [ORIGIINAL] Ultra Portable Wireless with Built in Mic up to 10 Hour Playtime works with iPhone iPad tablet Samsung and smart phones - Black Grille, and it served my purposes fairly well. It wasn't loud enough for our larger package trucks, but for the smaller ones, it worked fairly well. It was a bit of a strain to hear it, though, at highway speeds.I had a charging issue with the speaker after I had been using it for 8 months; I charged it all night, and the next day, it would run for a little while and go dead. I contacted Cambridge, and a helpful rep named Jennifer cheerfully offered to ship me the new OontZ Angle 3 as a free replacement for my older generation model that was acting up. It arrived two days later, and I've been loving it ever since. Even apart from their willingness to replace my product, the customer service is outstanding.Pros: It is louder. I had mentioned that the previous generation was difficult to hear at highway speeds; not the Angle 3. (FedEx Express drivers, note: this speaker will overcome the engine noise for the old Sprinters, the newer Benzes, and of course, the Nissans and the ancient Ford panel vans. The larger W700 and W900 vehicles are still just too loud for this sort of speaker, IMO).I love the play/pause button on the end of the speaker, which allows me to pause an audiobook without messing with my phone. The manual says that this button doesn't work with all apps, but it does work with the Audible app I use.The styling of the Angle 3 is superior to the earlier generation. The stick-on rubber knobs on the bottom of the earlier generation have been replaced by two inch-and-a-half-long rubber strips set into recesses on the bottom of the speaker. I have both in front of me; a gentle push will move the old generation speaker across the table with some resistance, but the Angle 3 is much more resistant to moving. One of the rubber knobs had come off the old model, and I had to stick it back on; I don't see how that sort of thing would even be possible with the Angle 3. As well, there is a rubber-like covering on both ends, and this makes the speaker less angular and ""sharp"".As with the old speaker, the battery life is truly outstanding. I have been surprised at how long a single charge will last.I'm no expert, but I find the clarity of the sound excellent. It certainly serves my purposes for listening to audiobooks.My single ""con"" for the speaker is that it shuts down (to conserve battery) after fifteen minutes of non-use, if it is not plugged in. Not that it's difficult to turn back on! But I'd prefer an option that lets it remain on indefinitely. But that is a minor detail, and doesn't keep me from rating this a 5-star product.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this speaker because I was looking for a relatively inexpensive speaker that I can use in the shower. I was looking at a few speakers but eventually decided on the OobtZ because of its features, price and sheer amount of positive feedback. In this review I will focus on the pros and cons that make this speaker a good choice for a speaker under $30.Starting off the shipping was fast as expected. I opened the box and got a fairly simple unvoxing with a charger, manual and 3.5 chord which I was very happy about because many speakers don't come with one. It came with a mostly full battery which was nice.  Initial thoughts on sound were as follows: It has a decent bass for the price and has mids and highs that were clear but a bit crunchy (especially at high volumes). It gets loud enough for a small rom and most certainly a shower or bathroom. Aesthetically it is very slick with a metal grill and rubber endcaps. The size also lends to excellent portability. The controls are easy to use and pairing was very simple. So to sum it all up I will list my personal pros and cons when using the speaker.ProsWater resistance for shower and water useGood portable sizeGood overall soundEasy controls and pairingConsLacks deep bass but this is to be expected with a speaker of this priceCrunchy highs but not so bad that it is hard to listen toNot fully waterproof so don't fully submerge itSo in conclusion this is a very well rounded speaker that is good in all categories but not necessarily amazing in sound which is expected for a $30 speaker. I would say this speaker is great for a shower speaker or something you throw in the bag to a pool, beach or for just casual listening if you don't need top notch sound.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"My trusty little CA speaker (non Bluetooth) had just died after 11 years of faithful service, so I was on the hunt for a replacement.  I searched Amazon extensively and decided on the OontZ Angle 3 (3rd Gen) because of the price and reviews.  Had I continued searching within the OontZ line of products, I would have purchased the slightly more expensive (and a bit larger) model with the ability to switch tracks from the speaker and the extended battery life.  But, I bought the OontZ Angle 3.  My first impression when it arrived was that it was way smaller than expected, but that's a good thing.  I use the unit with a 3mm headphone jack cable attached to my iPod, so I'm already way lower tech than the folks who will use this as a Bluetooth speaker.  I use this speaker on my motorcycle rides - not on the bike itself, but in the tent or motel when I land.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The bass could be a little deeper, but overall it sounds great and gets loud.  My minor complaint(s) with the unit are as follows:  1) it's all black  (by the way this comes in several colors, which I didn't realize when I ordered)  Because it's all black, the controls are hard to see  2) the little rubbery flap that lifts up (near the on/off button)  which contains the charging port and headphone jack - looks like it will tear off if not handled VERY carefully.  I play mine standing on end in order to get the most bass quality, otherwise the bass speaker is facing downward and the sound is somewhat muffled.  If I had it to do over, I would buy the larger OontZ Angle and buy it in a color other than black.  Otherwise, I love the speaker.

I can leave it on the charger for a full day and the light will just stay pulsing red. So I never know when it is actually done charging, or how long it actually takes to fully charge because there is not indicator.Battery life is pretty poor for a bluetooth speaker. This thing is a little over a year old and it gets around 8 hours of play before the battery dies.. It also doesn't give a warning that the battery is getting low, it just dies. By comparison, my cheap $20 anker BT headphones get nearly the same battery life. Also, my old Photive Hyrda speaker that I had for 3 years maintained it's battery life very well and would consistently get 18 hours of battery life even though it was rated to only get up to 8 hours.Maybe mine is a dud, because of all the good reviews. But the battery is definitely very poor. Also, I play music with the volume at around 50-70% so the battery life should be at least as good, or even better than they advertise. (Since they rate their battery life using the device at 2/3 volume (66%))As far as the waterproofing, it's very good. I use it in the shower all the time and have taken it kayaking and to the beach. Never had an issue with that. The sound is very good for it's size too.

The volume goes louder than I would ever play it in my home but I can see this being amazing in a crowded loud room. Let alone a shower.The bass is perfect, it's just a really good little speaker. I have a feeling well be getting a lot of use out of it. We've had other speakers before but they end up collecting dust because they were cheap and the sound quality was the same as a smart phone. I mean, the cheap ones aren't even comparable to this.Bluetooth connecting was seamless. For instance, I have a Bluetooth receiver in my car even after years of using it it takes 30 seconds to pair even with a remembered device. My husband pressed the pair button on his phone and it instantly paired. Although, if you do have some trouble pairing, you can always use the auxiliary cord included.This says it takes 5-6 hours to fully charge and the charge can last up to 12 hours at 2/3 of the volume. It also says you can use it while it charges.This was really good money spent. I don't think I've ever been more impressed with something for the price. If you had shown me this and I didn't know the price I would say it's worth 50$ which I wouldn't spend on a speaker. I'm so happy with this I'm gonna be buying more as gifts for Christmas for sure.

Battery life is reasonable, shows up in iOS and is in check with the specifications printed on manufacturer’s website.The Angle sports a triangular design with two drivers on the front configured in stereo and a passive radiator located at the bottom allowing the Angle 3 to resonate bass frequencies off the surface its placed on.The Angle 3 has two rubber pads on the bottom near both ends. I listen mostly to rock however if you play a track with excessive bass like “Billie Eilish - you should see me with a crown” at max volume the Angle 3 will move about on the table. This could have been prevented if SoundWorks installed weight strips in the Angle 3. This isn’t an issue for most music played through these but it’s still something to consider.Pairing the Angle 3 to my iPhone was simple and the connection is solid, even at great distances. The Angle 3 features a play/pause, volume controls. The volume controls are independent of iOS so you will have to set both at applicable levels.Films are a joy to watch on-the-go with the Angle 3 as audio plays back in sync with video. There is barely any noticeable latency when paired with my iPhone. Very important.Color: I love white electronics and would have appreciated SoundWorks providing the option of purchasing the Angle 3 in solid white as opposed to the black/white combination. As the option wasn’t available, I purchased the solid black version.The Angle 3 is a great little bluetooth speaker. It deliverers clear and balanced audio at an in-expensive price point. It could benefit from more bass, however considering the construction, competition and price point this is not a bad buy.

Today it completely went out on me for no reason. I never dropped it or anything. When it did work it was a pretty good speaker for the price. The buttons were pretty janky. I mean you get what you pay for but yea I got a good 3 months of light use out of it. Thank me later

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just opened the box - When it comes to quality sound from small speakers I am very skeptical. Distortion and flat sound is typical from tiny speakers - well I have been proven wrong - today's technology is truly amazing. After several months of research into bluetooth portable speakers I finally pulled the trigger on this awesome speaker from Cambridge Soundworks and my mind, and ears - are just blown away.The Oontz 3 is a small 12 hour battery or wall powered Bluetooth stereo speaker with AMAZING CLARITY and BASS - even played at high volume there is NO DISTORTION  - simply fills the room and crystal clear sound - you can answer phone calls, use direct AUX in and even take it into the shower with you.. it's water resistant.I am so pleasantly surprised with free shipping costing under $30 on Amazon it's worth every dime. The quality is incredible for the price !I highly recommend you check it out - I've already ordered the next version Oontz 3 PLUS which is larger, plays for 30 hours and has all the same great features!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Any speaker at this size is way too small to give you REAL BASS, instead look for a speaker that is Loud. I noticed all small speakers sort of dim down the volume when the base hits & is probably becase they run on battery & there's not enough power to keep that constance bass. Save your money & get the OontZ Angle 3 Enhanced.If you must have some unreal-bass then look at all of the ones below except #1,8,9 from the list below:I purchased all of this speakers:1.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this speaker for my workshop to listen to book tapes and music while working. The sound quality is very good. The Anker speaker I previously bought is also good, but I felt it had too much base and speech on it was hard to understand. The Angle 3 has a crisp sound that makes speech easy to understand. I also bought the zipper case to hold the Angle 3 and protect it from dust while not in use. Overall I would recommend this for anyone looking for a small bluetooth speaker. I have not used the speaker long enough for the battery to need recharging so I cannot comment on how long it lasts, but I have used it for over four hours with no problems.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased this speaker to play music during work. We stream background music in the office, low volume. This speaker's sound is somewhat tinny with very little bass at low volume.  It sounds better as you crank it up but even then doesn't provide the richness of some other portable speakers.  I've played it both bluetooth and accessory cord and both sound equivalent.  I do love its size and ease of use. It paired with both my phone and laptop flawlessly. Volume controls are simple and functional. Charging is easy and the battery life at low volume is easily 10+ hours. And, importantly, its sized to fit in my briefcase as I travel to different offices.  Still, I was hoping for a better sound quality.  I listened to another speaker, longer but narrower, that had a much richer sound and frequency response. It also cost about twice as much as this Oontz 3.Spend a little more, get a fair bit more. Probably worth it if you listen a lot.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a compact Bluetooth speaker at a good price. It paired quickly and effortlessly with my iPhone. I use it for listening to audio books and the sound is fine. Between the iPhone volume and the speaker volume the output is loud enough for my needs. I can’t comment on music quality or whether the speaker is loud enough to fill a room or be heard above a lot of ambient noise or conversation. HOWEVER:  the product listing caption says it has a range of 100ft. I sort of knew that was too good to be true but hey, they couldn’t say it if it wasn’t true, right? Apparently they can. Not only does it not have a 100ft range, it drops the signal as soon as I leave the room where my phone is. I have $10 wireless speakers from discount stores that work on the other side of my house. If you want an  inexpensive nice sounding Bluetooth speaker and don’t need to stray far from the audio source, buy this one. If you need wireless range, pick something else.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Old review updated:  I really hate slamming a product I initially loved, but I have tried everything, and my speaker I loved so much just quit working after two months.  I have tried to post an update once before, but I must not have completed it, because no one has contacted me, and I cannot believe I am expected to keep a product I bought on Amazon as a prime member when it did not even last 6 months.  The trouble is that, even fully charged, when I turn the speaker on, it comes on for a minute, then dies.  I have done all I can do, and so now I am back to using my trusty IHome bluetooth speaker (which I bought at Radio Shack two years ago and still works like a champ.  It does not sound as good as the Oontz Speaker, but I do not have to replace it 6 times per year.  Amazon or Cambridge SoundWorks should reach out to me now.  I will keep you all posted.I have purchased several of these little Blue-tooth speakers to carry with me on picnics, place around the house for music while I am cleaning, and to carry outside for cook outs or poker night.  I bought the best one from Radio Shack for $39, and that tennis ball sized I-Home speaker was the best until Oontz.  I got the sweet red Oontz speaker a couple of weeks ago, and this evening-bag sized speaker beats all five of its predecessors in sound AND price.  My husband and I listened to some of the glorious love songs of Whitney Houston Sat night over Rhapsody connected via Bluetooth to the Oontz.  We never got up to full volume, but it sounded like that angel was singing in our den, with a choir surrounding us.  Sunday we used it to watch a movie on my tablet.  When the bad guys were surrounded I could hear the bullets whizzing past my ears. That is a STEREO.  I plan to order a couple more in a few weeks.  Once again, Amazon Prime came through with a fine product at an excellent price and two day shipping was free, as always.  Thank you, Cambridge SoundWorks for giving us Boze Quality at a price we all can pay!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Back about 2005-2010 when mini Bluetooth speakers used to be the new toy everyone wanted (and you paid the price to be an early adopter) I was really into the fad and couldn’t stop looking for the perfect one. As a result I ended up with more of them than most dealers, speakers of every possible shape and gimmick. Some of them were knock your socks off impressive, including some so small I could stuff them in my carry on when I traveled so I could have music in my hotel rooms.These days there are a handful left from the major brands. One of them I was curious about was this series from Cambridge SoundWorks, a company I’ve known and respected since I worked directly with their founder Henry Kloss back in the late 80’s and early 90’s. Unlike the early days of Bluetooth mini speakers this little speaker was only nineteen bucks, probably the lowest I’ve ever paid for any speaker. I had mixed expectations. But I chose it both for its size and its shape, I was looking for a small personal speaker to put on the base of my desktop monitor to be able to listen to content at low volume without using my high-end Boston Acoustics system.The small size is truly impressive as is the surprisingly nice look and feel of the speaker. It is heavier than similar no name speakers and you almost have to wonder how they can sell it for such a low price. It comes with a micro USB charging cable and also a mini audio cable. The power switch is easily reached near the top of the back of the speaker where the audio input and charging port are also located behind a rubber flap. The rest of the controls are on the right side of the wedge.The speaker will pair easily with newer Bluetooth devices but it seems it is not 100% compatible with all of the many standards. For example it would not pair with my desktop computer without downloading an updated Bluetooth driver.The most important thing you probably want to know is how does it sound. I’m sorry to say that with almost 20,000 review written already, many of them high energy endorsements, I’m not as impressed. I have definitely heard better from similar sized, and even smaller, speakers. It’s not bad, but it’s not knock your socks off impressive. And it’s definitely not a speaker that you would choose if there were more than one or two listeners or for use outdoors.There are a couple of things to be aware of that I liked – one is that if you use the audio cable the speaker won’t shut off automatically after a few minutes like many other brands do, but it will shut off after 15 minutes of non-playing when used in the Bluetooth mode.  Interestingly, if you pair it with an Echo device the power stays on all the time in battery mode so you would probably want to keep it plugged in to a power source if that’s your plan.I also like that you only hear the pairing sound once the first time unlike many other brands that make a loud sound whenever they are powered on or when pairing is successful. For me that is a deal breaker.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay, so, every once in a while I get suckered and this is one of those times. Normally, I sort these things out and avoid the minefields of dubious products that promise big, but deliver small.Yes, this is a Bluetooth speaker, and yes, it does pair up and play music from your device, but to claim that the sound quality is anywhere near ""good"" is stretching things. There are some Bluetooth​ speakers that make you wonder just how someone managed to make so much sound come out of such a small device. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those. It sounds ""okay,"" but there is nothing about it that is going to amaze you in ANY way. Yes, it plays music, but don't expect it to amaze you in any way. It plays music like any small speaker would, but nothing more...or less, to be fair.Not sure if I'll keep this or not.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I did a lot of research before choosing this speaker. I was impressed by the large number of 5 star buyer ratings. The price was excellent as well. Speaker came packaged perfectly. Included was a 3 foot Micro-USB charging cable and 3 foot 3.5mm audio cable; I wish these were longer but that is just my personal preference. Speaker came partially charged. Instructions states it can be used while charging. Speaker pairs easily and quickly, but I did experience problems getting it to disconnect from one device to pair to a different source. I contacted the company and they were quick to respond back to me. Their customer service was excellent, fast, relevant and courteous. They even offered to call me to assure that the device was working properly or not. After working with it a few days the device started working as expected and has not had an issue ever since. Maybe it was user error? Not sure. I also ordered the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 PLUS. The Angle 3 PLUS offers 30 hours of playtime vs the Angle 3 which only offers 7 hours (a big difference). The Angle 3 PLUS is a tad taller at 6 1/2"". The Angle 3 is 5 1/4"", see attached photos. I didn't notice a sound quality difference but my musician son did. He ordered the 3 PLUS and says it is a better speaker than his Jawbone Bluetooth Speaker for less than half the cost. I use the smaller speaker, which sets on a high shelf in my shower, as it is water resistant & splash proof. The other sets on my office desk. If you are considering purchasing a Bluetooth speaker definitely consider the OontZ. I would go for the Angle 3 PLUS as the price difference is only about $7 unless a smaller speaker is your goal. I have referred several people to this powerful little speaker and all are very happy with their purchase.

Used it outside working in yard, in the shower, at my desk, without issue. Then one day it simply quit connecting via Bluetooth. I guess it works via wired connection but haven't tried.

I didn't have the same issue with a braven or jambox speaker.  it kept popping and skipping over and over and finally I stopped using bluetooth and used aux cable instead.  that led to another issue.  the aux cable connection has ridiculous static.  I tried 3 diff aux cables and two diff devices and the same result: background static when playing music.  to me, this device is not reliable enough.

I listen to music with my Echo, but, when in the kitchen, bedroom, etc., I use the OontZ 3 so that I don't have to have my Echo full volume and disturb my roommate!  The range is unbelievable!  I can even take it to the downstairs kitchen and it works great.  The sound that comes from this little speaker is exceptional.  It is a very full, rich sound.  While my Echo has great sound, I actually like the sound from this better.  You are also able to use the volume up/down buttons to go back or forward to the next song.  It has a pause button, also.  The charge lasts a very long time.  I bought this in June.  I use it from 2 - 6 hours a day and I have only recharged it once, but, only to keep it at full charge in case the electricity went out.  How wonderful it is to have a cordless speaker that is this great.  Makes storm power outages much more pleasant!  Power was out for 10 hours, went back out for 6 hours, and, without a charge, it worked perfectly for those 16 hours.  I absolutely love the non-skid rubber on the bottom.  Between my kitties and me, things are always getting knocked around. This speaker doesn't move!  It doesn't even slide easy!  In the kitchen, the OontZ 3 got splashed quite a bit.  The water stayed on the covering and wiped off easy.  Fixing to buy a second one for my roommate!  I LOVE IT!!!

I showed them how to use it (very simple to operate) and it will work perfectly for them in that sense. The size and the sound quality is good to.My biggest problem with this Bluetooth speaker is that it’s pure solid black (including all the buttons). The black buttons are very difficult to see because they blend in with the color of the device. You can’t see them unless you hold this device at a particular angle and under a bright light. What genius at the manufacture thought of this design? Stupid design. A younger person must have thought of it.The manufacturer could have easily made the buttons a different color (other than black) so that they can be seen easily. I had to put drops of white paint on top of the buttons so they can easily be seen now. I shouldn’t need to have done that. The manufacture should have designed it that way! How hard would that have been. Pathetic.If you are older, do not buy this. Choose another brand and just know that most of these tech companies these days design things for younger people and don’t give a crap about older people’s needs. Good luck.

I tried changing the fuses and my mechanic made sure it wasn't something he unintentionally caused and could correct when he was taking care of the alternator, all to no avail. And after the alternator, an A/C repair a couple of months ago, and work done on the fuel system a couple of months prior to that I'm not exactly in a place to replace the stereo, so I've been trying to get by the last couple of weeks with just my headset or one of the other Bluetooth speakers we have, including our beloved VicTsing. Unfortunately, the volume just could not compete with road noise intrusion and the bass was blown out and static-y.  That and I prefer to have my caterwauling masked by loud music and bass, so it's been a sad couple of weeks of commuting unless I stuck to podcasts and even then I couldn't really hear lower register sounds over the road noise.This little gem arrived yesterday and I was immediately blown away by just how loud it could get in a 10x15 room, let alone a vehicle cabin! The sound is clear and the bass is deep and not distorted, even at top volume. It has super grippy little feet on the bottom that kept it solidly on my dashboard for my entire commute, even going around corners and making turns! And while it's not exactly the same as having the surround of multiple speakers, front and back, it totally works as I need it to.  The sound fills the cabin and for the most part, it's akin to having my stereo back in working order. Thank you to Oontz for providing an inexpensive solution!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker was purchased over others because there was an Amazon recommendation next to it.  It just does not really sound good.  I have tried it in multiple settings, such as in the car, on office desk, hooked up to Amazon Dot in the kitchen.  It is OK for music and terrible for spoken word.  For music it boosts the sound volume of my other devices and adds base.  The trouble is the mid range of the speaker.  If you listen to any talk radio or books, do not buy this speaker.  It makes the voice of the speaker sound like he is singing/speaking on the chipmunks album.  I have never heard anything like it.  I tried downloading some equalizer apps, but that did not work either.  It is actually very bad to listen to this speaker and now I guess I will have to gift it to someone or just let it sit collecting dust, because I cannot stand to listen to it.  I am now also jaded to Amazon's choice or Amazon's pick or whatever they call it.  It is obviously just a brazen sales ploy instead of an actual recommendation like consumer reports or other rating sites.  I suspect from my experience with this speaker that they just recommended it to get rid of the stock.  I waffled between two stars 'I don't like it' and one star 'I hate it'.  I hate it.  One star. I have to make an addendum to this review. Since I was not able to figure out how to return this item, I have used it subsequently in a very limited fashion. The chipmunk sound that I described has not recurred, so I suspect and Internet or provider error. The sound quality is not great, but this is a very small speaker.  I am not thrilled with the sound but I’m also not extremely unhappy with the device as I was previously. Rating has been changed from one star to three stars

Packaging is a nonissue) I immediately blasted the volume and threw on some tunes. I was disappointed with the speaker even with the crazy low price (mid $20s). It was tinny. I dont have a bunch of fancy audiophile terminology to throw your way to convince you I know what I'm talking about, but I do listen to music for most of my waking hours and I know what sounds good and what frankly sounds like crap. It sounded like crap,Ive used it quite a bit since then and am much happier with the purchase. At low to mid volumes this thing really shines. It is still a cheap, portable bluetooth speaker; you can't even compare the sound to a decent stereo system. For what it is, though, it is a great little speaker. It is much smaller than I expected, is loud, is light, and seems to be living up to the waterproof claims, although I have not submerged it fully.I was disappointed to find that there is no way to attach a caribeener to this, as far as I can tell.I am happy with my choice and purchase.If you are looking for a similarly priced speaker to use in a dry, stable environment I like the DOSS Soundbox's sound a bit more.Neither of those will really compare to a decent sound system, of course, but for $20-$40 you can't expect much.

I changed my rating to a 3 star rating based on customer service.2nd one of these that I bought.  First one stopped charging after a couple years, thought it was due to a water spill that happened at about the same time.Bought this one Sep 2016.  Stopped working May 2017.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought three Bluetooth speakers hoping ONE would be usable.  All three ended up being keepers for different reasons. I bought the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3, the Anker Classic Portable, and the Boombotix REX.Portability:  All three are fantastic, no real difference.  If you want to nitpick, the Boombotix is the smallest, the Anker is next, and the Cambridge is the largest.  But again, none of them are really different.  I give an edge to the Boombotix for it's clip, it's more flexible. The clip is super hard to get open though. You aren't clipping it to anything thick.Construction and Ergonomics: All three seem durable and well built.  The Anker is clearly the best of the three. It's classy, attractive, and feels substantial.  And it doesn't walk itself around too much with vibration.  But the On/Off switch is terrible.  It's tiny and hard to use, you have to use your fingernail.  The other buttons are functional, but not as easy to use as the other two. The Boombotix is sturdy and easy to use, the buttons are a little close together, but they work well. It's walks around a little on a hard table, but not terribly. You will have to watch it though, or it will eventually fall off a table.  The Cambridge Angle 3 is sturdy and I love the shape. It works really well being able to either lay it down or stand it up. The function buttons are easy to use.  The On/Off button is not great, it's too small and in an obscure location. So much so that they have to put a little sticker pointing to it.  The rubber end caps are a mixed blessing.  I think they will help protect it, but they get really dirty really fast.  They pick up every tiny little bit of dust.  I recommend standing it up if you put a lot of volume through it because once the bass starts to thump it will bounce and wiggle it's way all over the place.  It's actually kinda funny looking.  But standing up the passive radiator on the bottom doesn't propel it all over.Sound: I was actually impressed with all three. None of them are on par with the large Sound Dock or Klipsch type speakers, but they could hardly be expected to compete with those at this size and price.The Cambridge is my favorite because it has more bass than the other two.  It's a clear winner in bass response. probably about 10-15% more. And that's important to me. The Anker actually has the best overall sound.  It's rich and clean. It's probably the ""best"" speaker of all three.  And the Boombotix is clearly the loudest.  It really puts out some sound.  none of them sound bad at all.  I would have been happy with any of the three if I hadn't heard the others.  But hearing them side by side the Angle 3 fits what I need best.Connectivity: None were bad, but the Boombotix lost connection first, the Angle 3 and the Anker had no trouble at all at 30ft even through walls (but none liked going through a stone fireplace LOL).  None were an issue connecting.  They were all easy as pie to pair.  The Anker was slowest when powering on and trying to find my phone, but we're talking about less than 10 seconds total time for the slowest.Intangibles: The Boombotix has some features that are really appealing. There's an audio out jack, which you can use to run a second speaker (of any make).  So that give you options. Send Bluetooth to the speaker and then it will send it to a second speaker. If you don't have a Bluetooth connection on one of your larger speakers you can send signal to the REX and it will connect to your larger speaker.  Options are nice.I chose the Angle 3, it fits my needs best with the best imitation of bass, but the others are good enough that I've decided to keep them and use them too.  The Anker is nicest, and the Boombotix is loudest and most versatile.  I can't really speak to longevity since I haven't had them very long, but I don't think any of them will die on me. Don't be afraid to buy any of these. Just pick the one that fits best.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like any product, this speaker has both good and less than good points.  Having just received it, I am limited to immediate experience, although thus far more good than bad:Oontz Angle 3 Speaker (Geez, what a name!) appears well constructed, with good, solid feeling to it; although it isn't at all heavy.  It doesn't have any apparition nor feeling of being loosely constructed, with good and tight fitting rubber seals and grommet for power/hard cable connection port.  It was a bit difficult to get grommet open for charge the first time, but using some blunt tool removes it easy enough...Make sure you don't use anything like a sharp knife or like edged tool, because the rubber grommet could be accidentally cut easily enough when trying to lift it out initially. That's not a point for complaint, because speaker is supposed to be water proof enough to take in the shower, although user pamphlet expressively warns against full submersion.  I as well like the fact the pamphlet is well written, easy to understand in explaining functions and set up, and I am thrilled by the fact it is completely in English; as opposed to multi language documents that are written in several languages at microdot font. It's definitely a high point for me to see the instructions are completely in English, but higher still, designed and engineered in America! It is manufactured in China however (What isn't these days?), and I would have preferred American manufacturing and paid more for it if it was.Bluetooth pairing with my iPhone 7 Plus was simple and easy, and activated the pairing mode was very easy, requiring only the user depress and hold the Bluetooth button, which is lit when in use, for a few seconds until it reacts by fast flash.  After that, it's just a matter of selecting it in iPhone settings menu, and it will continue to ""look"" for the speaker after powering on and off, or turning it on for other sessions.  Although it hasn't yet been a problem for me with Oontz speaker, it is sometimes important to reselect chosen device in iPhone if you want another device selection (such as Plantronics headset or other device); although that's iPhone's issue and not Oontz Angle 3 Speaker's.So how does it sound? (Thought you'd never ask!):  It's a fairly good, responsive speaker with good resonating effects, deep base response, and good mid and high end response.  Bear in mind this is a small, portable speaker running off an internal battery, so if you're wanting several hundred watts to rival Bose speakers, this ain't it! But it's no slouch of a portable speaker either, and it would be absolutely perfect for bedside, hotel, bathroom-shower morning music and like use.  It would be perfect for kids' rooms, although no kid is truly happy unless he can annoy parents with high volume, preferably including the neighbors while at it, and this little speaker just isn't made for window-shattering output.It gets a little tricky if your playlists are ""eclectic from hell"" like mine are! Neal Young and Rolling Stones comes out great using iPhone's ""Small Speakers"" EQ setting, Temptations does better using ""R&B"" or ""Pop,"" and I have yet to isolate best for Grateful Dead...But ""Rock"" comes near (but not quite there) the mark. Junior Walker imposes a problem I have yet to solve...And who can live without?  All in, you'll likely find a good setting for one album or genre of music, but you would do well to expect to use more than one if you really like your music like I do. Still, that no buzz killer by me. I like it just as much! Again, if you want to share your music with residents two flights up or around the block, this won't be your answer, but I have a 700 watt Yamaha receiver to accomplish that need anyway.Oontz Angle 3 speaker comes partially charged enough to pair and try right out of the box, although I soon connected it to supplied cable and to a USB charger I already had.  Instructions say it can take ""5-6 hours to fully charge a low battery,"" but how ""low"" it is on delivery is anyone's guess.  Good news is you can listen while charging it, and it's recommended to fully charge initially. I note user pamphlet states higher volume level will affect play time, but it says you'll get ""up to 12 hours at 2/3 volume.""Hands Free function for telephone user however, does present a weak point.  Sound of incoming party is reasonably good and nothing to complain about, but the microphone on the Oontz Angle 3 does indeed leave much to be desired! I tried it in a reasonably quiet surrounding without background noise, a little less than two feet away in normal voice that I would use with other hands free telephone devices, using my own voicemail message to gauge sound quality. The result was very tinny, with a very distant reception that gives perception of being very far from the microphone when you're not.  Since I don't expect to ever much rely on that function anyway, at most to grab a very important call while in the shower or like setting, that's no deal breaker to me.  If you expect to make a lot of hands free telephone use however, you should be aware of that and immediately test it to see if it's something you can rely on. The upside is it automatically went into telephone mode and enabled the microphone without having to switch, and it immediately returned to playing music once call was terminated. Since cell phone issues can be sourced to any number of reasons (connection, device location, etc,), it isn't always evident for where the problem cause is...So test that soon, once you get it!All in, end of the day, and bottom line:  This is a great deal!  I believe I am getting more than what I would expect for $25 Bluetooth-connected, small portable speaker, and it sounds really good in the entire room, and isn't limited to being sweet-spot in front of it. The base comes most from the bottom of speaker and has easily discernible mid and high range outputs, which is hard to find on small speakers at all, let alone portable AND Bluetooth. It will easily be benefited in smaller space with tiled walls like most bathrooms tend to be, and neither it nor the manufacturers fear a hot shower, provided you don't ask it to scrub your back. It would work very well in a kitchen, bedside or hotel room without causing the front desk to ask you for an much earlier check out...Like now or sooner.  It has it's limitations like anything else, but for reasonable volumes and user expectations, it's still a score!  There's only one thing I would want that wasn't part of the buying experience: Free shipping from Amazon (Hint, hint!!).  I would buy another and I do recommend it! Thumbs up, stars, and a few backflips...And nobody is giving me anything for this review.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker is very poor quality. I've used it for several months now and get more frustrated every time. I listen to it for about 30-45 minutes at a time. Sometime is works great and sometimes I want to throw it out the window. The issue is with the Bluetooth. Most days, the speaker has little hiccups where it looses Bluetooth connection, pauses the music, and then reconnects. I then have to press play again on my phone. This regularly happens 2-3 times PER song! Incredibly frustrating. I tried using an aux cable to get around the Bluetooth issue, but using an aux cable lowers the overall volume of the speaker significantly. Do not buy!

The first one I got stopped working within the  first couple months, I had gotten the extended warranty and was sent a replacement,  that one stopped working as well within a couple months.  They sent yet another replacement even though I mentioned my concern that the speakers weren't working after a few months.  The replacement again lasted a few months and stopped.  I wrote the company again and they are saying sorry you're no longer under warranty not our problem.  I will never buy speakers from this company again and suggest others not to, especially when they keep breaking down so quickly and the company says basically yeah we aren't standing behind our product.  Look elsewhere for speakers and know even with extended warranty they won't back up products not even a year old.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome product!! I purchased this for a cross country road trip in an '80s Camaro with a busted radio. It worked great for my cross country trip; I could hear it over road noise and the battery life was sufficient for an 8 hour day.  (The cigarette lighter was also busted so it was important for the battery to last as long as possible.)  The sound quality is also excellent!  It really thumps when you crank it up.  I love this little speaker!  I use it all the time at home, its so portable and again I stress the great battery life.  It goes for quite a while between charges.  I had no problems pairing it with my Samsung Galaxy S6.  I also like the rubber feet it has which made it stay right on the dash where I placed it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I cross shopped the Oontz Angle 3 and Amazon Basics speaker (the cheaper 2.5-watt speaker from Amazon, NOT the 3W amazonbasics speaker). I was surprised to see no reviews comparing the two since they are a similar price so this experience may help others like myself.I use this with a fire tablet HD8 which we keep in Show mode in the kitchen (the stock speakers on the tablet are terrible).SOUND QUALITY: The sound quality between these two is very close. If you are not picky you may not notice a difference at lower volumes.  However the Oontz Angle 3 has better clarity particularly when the volume is turned up. I would place the sound quality similar to the larger Amazon Echo cylinder (I have the 1st gen Echo). However these both will get louder than the Echo so they may sound better if you like loud music (see volume below).BASS: Don't expect this to shake the house like your aftermarket car stereo system. There is just a slight thump and nothing that will cause vibrations. But enough that you know bass belongs in that part of the song. That thump is more subdued in the AmazonBasics speaker but only slightly.VOLUME: Both of these get quite loud. We never have this at full volume, usually keep the Oontz at about 60-70% volume at most, and this is loud enough that we are basically yelling over the speaker to talk in the kitchen.CONNECTIVITY and BATTERY: I combined these topics because both are excellent, connecting either the AmazonBasics or Oontz was a breeze. Neither breaks connection and both batteries have yet to die after weeks of staying on. Oontz includes a 3.5mm stereo aux cable and Amazon does not. This may be a deal breaker for some of you. Note that BOTH have the jack on the device, but only the Oontz gives the wire.One caveat: The Oontz will power down if it is not plugged in. Supposedly this is not the case if it is connected to an Echo. However when connected to my Fire HD8 tablet in Show mode, it does still power down. To work around this I have to keep the Oontz plugged in so it won't shut down. This is not the case with AmazonBasics 2.5W speaker connected to my HD8.BUILD QUALITY: I was impressed with both of these speakers build quality. The Oontz has a more rubber feel whereas AmazonBasics is plastic. Buttons are easier to press on the Amazonbasics speaker and also easier to see. The reason being that the Oontz is black rubber with black volume symbols so you really need to look at it to find the button. But that is a minor gripe. When used with an Alexa device, you'll probably adjust volume by voice.I think the Rubber would do better with drops or being thrown in a bag, but I did not actually test this. With that said if you plan to keep the speaker in one place I don't think either of these will fall apart easily.OTHER: The Oontz can be placed vertically or horizontally. The AmazonBasics speaker can only be placed horizontally. If your space is tight, Oontz may win out here.One last thing: THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WITH THE SPEAKER ITSELF. However, this applies if you are planning to use this like I am. This speaker is connected to my HD8 via bluetooth. When music is playing, the tablet has such a poor mic that it cannot pick up the ""Alexa"" command unless I pause the music. When no music is playing the mic seems to pick up just fine. This has bothered me to the point I may just put my regular first gen Echo back in the kitchen. It's frustrating to play music and not be able to stop it with your voice (yes I know, first world problems).CONCLUSION: Both are quality products, Oontz just barely edges out the AmazonBasics speaker in clarity and bass but only at higher volumes. Also Oontz includes a 3.5mm wire whereas AmazonBasics speaker does not. Both will greatly augment sound quality of an Amazon Fire tablet or Echo Dot. Quality is similar to the cylinder Amazon Echo but louder.Edited for clarification.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had this speaker for several months, and it is fantastic. It's very small, with a similar footprint as a cellphone, and the build quality is shockingly good, with a metal grill, high quality plastics, and nice silicone end pieces.It has excellent sound with surprisingly good bass. I have started using it as a practice amp for my electric bass and it sounds good, though it does distort if I play loudly on the lowest string. It would work perfectly as a small guitar amp. The big surprise is the sheer volume, though - it has annoy your neighbor kind of volume in a tiny package. It is very slightly quieter than a good set of desktop speakers on maximum volume, enough to hurt if you're sitting right next to it.The battery life is great, and it doesn't lose much over time either, it still had a 90% charge after two months on a shelf. It connects instantly and reliably to my gen 1 pixel and mobile playback controls work perfectly. (volume up/down, play/pause, and forward/back)From some other reviews it seems like there may be some minor quality control issues, but Amazon has a fantastic return policy, so don't worry about it. I haven't had any problems with it at all.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this portable speaker to play music when we go to the beach, an upcoming rafting trip, upcoming camping trip etc. I was immediately surprised by the size of this speaker - it's much smaller than I thought it would be - which is great in my books as that adds to portability. Secondly, I played a song on it (Despacito) and Luis Fonsi absolutely killed it on these speakers! It was LOUD and clear. Bass was beautiful too. Pairing with my iPhone literally took seconds.Now with my camping and rafting trips a few weeks out, I placed this speaker in my home office while still paired with my phone. I got an incoming call and it unintentionally went to this speaker. Call quality and volume = beautiful. But what really surprised me was that the built in mic works great too! If any of you work from home and take phone calls/conference calls - this little speaker will quickly become your best bud. I have a landline that i use to make phone calls primarily because of the speakerphone - i no longer need that as using this speaker in conjunction with my phone is the ultimate combo.Love love it. Highly recommend.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"The sound quality and overall functionality of the device isn't bad. However, the build quality leaves a lot to be desired. I say this because the case of the speaker melted and warped. Yes, this really happened. The speaker, which I was using in place of my broken aux port, literally cannot withstand the direct sunlight on a hot day. The case of the speaker began melting and is now warped. There is now a noticeable difference in the quality of audio. Aditionally, the battery is maintaining far fewer hours of charge. That is of course, when it charges. Which, I'm sure, is do to the fact that the case melted and is now warped. Did I mention that the case melted and warped? That all being said, if you intend to use this in your car or next to a fire while camping (or a heat source and etc.), do not. In fact, if you aren't in the frigid indoors just save yourself the trouble and don't use it. I say this because your speaker will likely warp due to it melting.I will be adding a few photos to this review in a couple hours when the chance arises.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this speaker.  I've had it for about three months and have used it several times before writing this.  I love music and really want a quality Bluetooth speaker with a well-rounded sound.  This OontZ delivers.  It has a great sound with a nice low end.  Of course, it doesn't have a deep end like a separate subwoofer, but you can hear the bass notes really well.  I play bass guitar and want to hear the low end.  This speaker delivers really well.  The controls are easy to use and I have had no problems connecting to my iPhone or iPad.  The battery life is great as well.  It will last all day long.This speaker really shines when it is set on a flat, solid surface as the bass comes from the bottom.  It loses the low end if it is carried in your hand or just tossed on a bed or placed outside on the grass.  If it is placed on any solid surface the speaker produces a fantastic tone.  I own a DOSS Touch Bluetooth speaker and a Bose Soundlink Bluetooth speaker.  The Oontz outperforms the DOSS hands down based off of controls, sound (when placed on a flat surface) and simplicity of use.  The DOSS does sound great and is not dependent on placement nearly as much as the Oontz, but I prefer the Oontz.  The Bose does sound better than this Oontz with similar controls but not by much.  And the price of the Oontz is much better.  If money were no problem and sound quality was the top priority, I would pick the Bose over this speaker.  But considering you could purchase at least four of these Oontz speakers for the price of one Bose, the Oontz wins hands down. It sounds great, has a long battery life, connects easily and does NOT have an annoying series of beeps like the DOSS when connecting to your phone.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the older OontZ Ultra-Portable Wireless speaker. This unit is a replacement. It's a great speaker, with many of the Oontz features, but updated for better performance. The sound quality is better than my previous Oontz with more bass and richer highs and midrange. I use this as a bedroom speaker for relaxation and sleeping sound tracks like ocean and forest sounds. The volume is great and has plenty of range and power for the room. The sound quality doesn't suffer at higher volumes. I listen to ambient sounds as I mentioned above as well as acoustic guitar and blue grass. I've been pleased with the sound quality for that type of music. I've used the speaker outside on my deck at a picnic table and it had plenty of power to fill the area. Many people describe sound quality from these type of speakers as ""tinny"" or weak, however this speaker is not like that. A great feature of the speaker is the hands free calling feature. This works seamlessly when the speaker is paired with my phone (iPhone 6+) and I'm pleased with the call sound and the microphone. The company claims this speaker is redesigned to be more powerful and have deeper bass. I agree with that claim, however my expectations are aligned with a speaker of this type and size. You should not be expecting sound like you would get from larger stereo speakers. My recommendation for the BEST performance and sound quality is to also download a high quality Equalizer App for your iPhone and use it when playing your music. The app I use is called ""Equalizer"" from Audioforge. My previous Oontz was difficult to pair, but pairing this speaker is quick and easy. The annoying blue light that was located on the front of the older Oontz has been relocated to the side panel of this speaker. My experience with battery life is about 7 -12 hours between charges. However, I would like a longer charging cord. The included USB cord is quite short (6 inches) and has to located directly near the power source. The speaker does not come with a wall charger. A 3.5 mm, 32 inch audio cable is included.  This speaker is designed to be water proof and as such the controls are on the sealed, silicone end panel and have raised ridges to help you locate them. The charging port and 3.5 mm jack port are located on the back panel of the speaker under a tight, silicone flap that's just a bit tricky to open. The sealed power button is directly above the ports. The front panel is a typical metal, perforated grill. The bass radiators are on the bottom panel along with nonskid silicone feet. Overall, I enjoy this speaker, I am pleased with its performance, the sale price was low compared to the quality and features and Cambridge is a known, established, American company. I've contacted Cambridge customer service and received prompt and expert service. The Cambridge website has plenty of resources and information as well. If you need a quality, portable speaker with great performance, give this one a try.

It's worth noting that those died in part because of on/off switches that would often accidentally slip on in luggage, ruining the battery; they also had rather cumbersome wires.These address those issues and more, including adding a number of great little touches:-Rubberized buttons that are water resistant-The speaker automatically shuts off if no sound is coming through them to preserve battery--unless it's already plugged in; great design feature!-Great battery life, partly because of the above point, and partly because it's just a high quality, high capacity battery-Did I mention that the sound is amazing for its size and price?! Brought this to my friend's bachelor party in Mexico and it was plenty loud for the big house we rented out. No, the speaker is not a Bose 7.1 Dolby Surround home theater set up, but it shouldn't be. It's only about 5 inches wide and costs the same as a trip to the convenience store.-Bluetooth reduces the need for cords, but also works with a standard headphone jack (and comes with the cord!), which you can use to plug into a computer, for exampleAltogether it's one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sounds great, battery last for many hours, and it can play while it is charging. There are days where I start playing music when I wake up in the morning and I don't need to start charging it until dinner time or later. I've used it outside while working in the yard and the sound projects a surprising distance considering the size of this thing, and with no distortion! To reiterate that last point, this thing can get LOUD, especially indoors. No problems with the Bluetooth pairing, very simple to manage. Bass is directed downwards and seems to reflect off of whatever it is sitting on, so you will get better sound when placed on a hard surface. When on a hard surface, the bass sounds quite good for the price of this thing. You definitely lose out on some audio quality when this is on soft surface like a couch/bed or in your hand, it is very noticeable when you place it on a proper surface. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality Bluetooth speaker at a very reasonable price.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Man, this is tough to review. All 3 do a commendable job given their size and price, and based on that alone I'd give them all 5 stars. Given the sound quality itself, however, I'd say they sounded good but not great, which is why I ultimately gave each of them 4 stars - MAYBE 5 stars for the SoundCore 2. You're definitely trading some sound quality for portability.All 3 seemed well built and solid. The SoundCores were a notch heavier, and while all 3 have an Aux input jack, the SoundCores don't include the cable. The OontZ does. All 3 include a USB-based charging cable but none include a plug-in wall adapter. I thought the OontZ had better/clearer instructions, but they all easily connected to Alexa. Haven't tried anything else yet. The OontZ and SoundCore2 are ""splash"" waterproof, the SoundCore is not. The SoundCores play a short multi-note audio tone when powered on, and when connecting to a bluetooth source, with no apparent way to turn it off, but it was subdued and I didn't find it objectionable. The OontZ is silent. All 3 have raised buttons for power, volume, bluetooth, etc, but I DON'T like that they're all the same color as the case. You either have to shine a light to see them, or fumble around by feel. Annoying and unnecessary. I don't care that making them white or gray or whatever ""ruins the clean lines"" - it's a portable speaker, not a piece of furniture.Now, I'm not an audiophile, but I do understand that you're never going to get subwoofer-like bass and top quality sound from small speakers like these. For this comparison I listened to the same songs played from the same source (Alexa), at the same volume, 30 degrees off center and from about 8' away. No equalizing - just as-is straight out of Alexa.OontZ Angle 3:Louder than the SoundCores. Highs and midranges were distinctly brighter and clearer as well - actually quite impressive. Even my self-proclaimed ""tone deaf"" wife could easily hear the difference. Unfortunately, while that end of the spectrum sounded good, it also kinda drowned out whatever bass was present. You could say there was a bass ""presence"", but it was more of a ""whap"" than a ""thump"". Overall it made the sound seem a little unbalanced toward the high end.Anker SoundCore:Highs and midrange were more subdued, which is probably why it seemed quieter. Compared the OontZ this speaker sounded a little like it was laying face down in a pillow. Even when Alexa ""talked"" you could tell her voice was more muffled. That, however, allowed more of the bass to shine thru and made for a little more balanced overall sound. When a song hit a bass note it was a little more pronounced and deeper than the OontZ. Now (depending on your ""ear""), if you just walked into a room with the SoundCore playing you may not notice the more subdued highs, but right after hearing the Oontz it was quite noticeable.So bottom line, if you dig highs & midrange and don't care as much about bass, the Oontz is definitely your speaker. If you like a more balanced sound at the cost of brighter highs, the SoundCore is the way to go.Me? I'd go with the OontZ by the slightest of margins. While the SoundCore may have a slight edge in bass, the OontZ's has a bigger edge in highs - making it the better overall speaker (to me).UPDATE 10/31/2018:The SoundCore 2 arrived. Noticeably richer sound than the original SoundCore - mainly due to a fuller bass. Won't rival a sub-woofer but it was impressive for such a small speaker. Highs seemed slightly more pronounced as well (vs the original SC), but it was hard to tell if that was real or it just seemed that way next to the richer bass. Overall the fullest, richest sound of the 3 speakers, and right now my top pick. Being $10 more you'd expect it to sound at least a little better, and it does.It also adds ""splash"" waterproofing, with a convenient tab you can pull to open the rubber cover that protects the jacks. The OontZ requires some digging to lift enough of the cover to grab.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this to go with an Echo Dot. The Bluetooth works great, the sound is clear, and the battery lasts a long time. But other reviewers' claims of good bass response are crazy talk. I guess compared to a cell phone that may be correct, but even compared to a normal Echo (not Dot) this thing is weak in the bass department, to the point that I find listening to it really annoying and unpleasant. The thing is, it shakes and vibrates like it's really working hard, so I even went so far as to open it up to verify that the speakers hadn't been wired out of phase, but nope they were wired correctly. I'll probably add a woofer output jack, but in reality I'll probably end up giving it to Goodwill.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this speaker hoping that it would have good Bluetooth range and it didn't disappoint. I'm able to move it freely around the house and even outside on our patio and it stays connected ( specs state up to 100 ft. range). This is a lot better than another speaker I have which disconnects frequently at very modest distances.I like the shape and the sound quality is quite good considering the price. Connecting to my PC or smartphone is simple and the volume is very good as well.It would be a five star item except for a couple of things. While I understand the effort to make the speaker water resistant the small rubber ""press in place"" cover over the USB charging port is a bit fussy to press into place and stay there. Also, the waterproof on/off membrane switch seems like a delicate thing that could prove to be a weak point going forward. Time will tell. All in all I am delighted with this speaker and I believe most buyers will be as well.

Because it is a BEAST.We had a wiener roast last October, where I used this to play music from the edge of the porch. Since we haven't had any outdoor parties since then, I forgot that I'd left it out there. I came across it today. That's right. This thing survived SEVEN MONTHS outside—including a harsh Ohio winter. It doesn't look great now, but I just charged it up, and it works perfectly! So impressed.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this little Bluetooth speaker! Oh My!! I was not expecting it to work so seamlessly and sound so great. This is small and compact so I can use it in my car or when working from my laptop to listen to podcasts and music. Its perfect. It pairs effortlessly with my phone. It's small and light to carry around. The indicators work as you would expect. At this price point this is almost perfect. The only critique is I wish I could have bought 2 to pair together to get a stereo effect with music. I bought this for my car (which has no bluetooth) and I bought two Aomais Sport II for my home office. I love the OontZ better than the Aomais for ease of use and pairing. I have had trouble pairing with the Aomais and though I like the sound prompts of the latter,, it is really annoying to hear ""charging"" repeatedly when I'm trying to use it while charging! Why would they design a prompt like that? So OontZ gets my vote hands down. And I must add I am not a techie by any means so these purchases were a leap of faith but I already am so grateful for the pricepoints that made me willing to try them--they are enabling me to listen to podcasts and music wherever I am in my home.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this exclusively in the shower in my small bathroom.  I purchased this to replace a speaker that I have had for about 3 years. It was a small 5-watt outdoor speaker from Aukey that had since been discontinued. The battery life started to deteriorate, so I started to look for a slightly better sound on a budget, and of course, better battery life.  After some research I settled on the Oontz.  This speaker more than fits the bill!a) SOUND: The sound is fuller than my previous speaker, doesn't distort, and with 10 watts of power, it is LOUDER (especially in a small room, i.e. bathroom).b) BATTERY: The battery life is phenomenal! I know I only use it for about 25 minutes a day, but I love having to charge it only once a month at most. The remaining battery charge conveniently appears in my phone's Bluetooth settings which helps me keep track of it.c) WIRELESS RANGE: Big improvement over my previous speaker.  The Oontz has a 100 foot range (unobstructed); I can keep my phone charging in one room while playing music in the shower.  I couldn't do this reliably before.d) CONTROLS:  Button layout works well.  The volume and track controls share the same 2 buttons but it's a simple matter of press vs press and hold.  Play and pause are on the same button as well.  You have one button for phone call and Bluetooth controls: answer and end calls (with one press), reject calls (press and hold) and pairing mode (press and hold).  You have a dedicated power button and it is alone on another side of the speaker (with the auxiliary input jack and charging port), you will not accidentally power the speaker off when trying to operate any of the other buttons.  You have 2 LED lights, a red one by the power button and a blue one with the other controls.  These lights prove useful when determining the status of certain functions and features.e) FLEXIBLE: You can use this with any bluetooth device (wirelessly) or use it with any device with a headphone jack via the auxiliary input jack (wired).  You can use it while plugged into the charger, or not.  You can keep it plugged in without any detrimental effects to the battery (per the manufacturer) if you're interested in using this with an Amazon Echo Dot or the like.f) PRICE: All of this for a very reasonable price.  The same price, in fact, that I paid for the Aukey speaker I had previously.I was so impressed with this little speaker that I purchased one of it's big brothers, The Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, not too longer after!

No lights, no sounds, completely dead.------------ Original Review ------------This has been an awesome speaker using it with the Samsung s5 phone.  I now have the Samsung s7 and about half of the time it fails to pair.  After repeatedly cycles of off and on, deleting from phone then repairing a few times it plays again.  Never had this issues with the Samsung s5 phone.  It would be hard to recommend it to someone with an Samsung s7 phone.  Otherwise it's really nice and was a great deal on sale.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW. Seriously. WOW. This lil devil CRANKS!Here’s the thing: I’ve been listening to incredible music through incredible garbage with the iPhone speaker. I mainly listen to jazz/rock fusion and progressive rock (among the various fashions of music), and the work that these musicians place on recording is performed with detail and intricacy, and for the listener to appreciate the effort achieved in the works, far more is required from the system than one dinky little micro-speaker can produce.Incomes the OontZ Gen 3 Bluetooth Speaker system, and no more sad reminders of how much I’ve missed the full, rich blend of bass, midrange, and treble tonalities. This unit’s output is far more than are my simple needs of bringing music to my home patio or kitchen. One might imagine his daughter cranking up some cray cray hip hop on this beast.A word to the wise (or, even if you’re a couple fries short an order): get a nice graphic equalizer to bring the sound together. They’re easy to use and graphic equalizers make all the difference in the world. The OontZ Gen 3 pumps A LOT of lower-range bass, and you may need to adjust the volumes on both your device and the OontZ Gen 3. I personally lowered the volume on the OontZ Gen 3 to a little more than halfway up, and I do all the volume controlling from my device; it’s easier that way IMO.So, whether you listen to the Dixie Dregs or the Dixie Chicks, this speaker system will make your little heart happy, AND IT’S SO INEXPENSIVE!Perfect price! Consumer weary! 👍🏼

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this because I didn't want to replace the stereo in my 2003 car.  It's old enough that it has a 1 CD player and... a tape deck!  I listen to a lot of podcasts and audiobooks in my car and my phone's speakers aren't loud enough to cut it.  This speaker does the trick.  The sound is really clear and is loud enough that I can listen even when I have studded snow tires on, which make my car a lot louder.  I haven't listened to any music with this yet, so I can't comment on that.I might get some Command velcro stuff to stick it to the dash, but for now, it just lives in the passenger seat.  It's also small enough to fit in my already crowded glove box.  My car has an inverter, so I can charge it right in the car, which is a nice perk.I wish I had thought of this years ago.  I'm no audiophile, but I think the sound is great and the price is right.  My one complaint, that goes for every rechargeable item, is that the battery would be hard to replace.  Batteries don't last forever so this will eventually become an expensive paperweight.  This just creates waste and makes me sad.  Rechargeable items should be designed so that the batteries are replaceable.

I wanted a small Bluetooth speaker for my laptop, this speaker fills the void that the tinny Acer laptop speakers miss. Its sound is almost as good as the echo.I've found for better bass, lay it flat, the passive radiators definitely help. We're talking basic features here, but for myself it sounds darn good for $30. As far as longevity goes, I'm on the fence, a 90 day warranty isn't the best and since a lot of reviewers pointed out, they ended up with a paper weight. Also take into consideration that close to 20,000 units have beens sold, so it's fair to say you'll end up with a few bad ones, which is why I opted to spend the three bucks for the additional warranty.I've extracted even more bass from this little guy with my phone's graphic EQ, and the sound doesn't distort or drop off either way.Don't dunk it, but yeah you could take it to the beach, just make sure the rubber flap is closed on the charging port.

I also recently took it on a road trip and it played approximately 3 hours with no problem before dying. Since dying I attempted to charge it and the sound wouldn't transfer on via Bluetooth or aux cord. Sucky thing is that it's more than 3 months beyond the warranty so I can't return it.I've had it for the past two months and think it's a great product. I've used it in the shower or generally around the house. The sounds is very loud and bright. You can monitor the sound both with the dials or through the source of the sound (e.g. phone or computer). I've used it both with my phone and with my laptop, and it does great at amplifying the sounds when I'm streaming a movie. The charge stays forever. I use it several times a week and have only charged it 2-3 times since I've purchased it.Cons- You can't toggle back and forth for different music. Only pause, and volume.- The bluetooth range doesn't do well when I'm moving it from my downstairs to upstairs without having my phone close. The sounds starts to get choppy.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Do not listen to the negative reviews, that is either user error or a fluke. Now, I will admit I just got this, and immediately upon seeing its size and weight I thought it was going to be cheap crap. I can’t speak to battery life yet or longevity, and I will update if needed.But let’s just say, sometimes good things DO come in small packages. Seriously, it’s not even as long as my stretched out hand (I put it next to my standard sized men’s wallet to illustrate). In the past I’ve gotten $25 Bluetooth speakers with good reputations (like the “Venstar Taco”) and found the audio quality to be terrible. I’m an audio guy, I have a nice turntable and stereo and I know what I’m looking for.Audio quality:I was astounded that this little thing could put out sound as crisp, clear, present and balanced as it does. My last good sounding bt speaker was 3x the size. For its size & price, it sounds amazing. I tried it with punk, metal, acoustic, alt rock, hip hop, and stand up comedy. It sounds great all around.IF YOU ARE A BASS-HEAD AND WANT A TON OF THUMP, this probably isn’t for you. The audio quality is great, and it’s got some punch in the low end (Queen “Another One Bites The Dust” sounds awesome, but hip hop sounds kinda tame and weak)... But I recommend you look for another oontZ with a bass boost because the sound IS good.Is it loud? It’s KIND OF LOUD. I had my phone up all the way (minus one notch) and the speaker maxed out. It did not distort for me at all, and it was as loud or slightly louder than I need it to be (I want a speaker for showering, doing things around the house, cooking etc). Would it work outside, probably if it’s close by. Could you hear it while sawing wood? Probably not. But I’d imagine it’s comparable to your average similarly priced CD player boom box. I also listen to hard rock and like it loud all of the time, I go to a lot of concerts so I like being overwhelmed by sound. So, it’s decent.Does it pair to your devices easily? Yes. It paired to my iPhone immediately, no hassle. Then without disconnecting my iPhone, I pushed the Bluetooth button on the side and my MacBook recognized it immediately and connected just a couple seconds later. There was no “I have to go to settings and disconnect my phone first, then go through a connect process again with another device”, it’s quick and painless.I definitely recommend, and I would buy this again.

I'm a little flabbergasted how easy it was to set up this device. From signing for the delivery to singing along with the rock'n'roll took about ten minutes.Most important, though, is the sound, and I had my doubts. I work 13-hour shifts and wanted to hear my tunes in a *loud* workplace, before and after my 9-5 colleagues go home. But my desk is only about 15 feet from the roaring HVAC unit that makes luxuries like *thinking* and conversation with coworkers difficult.Well, to my honest surprise, this affordable and silly-named ""OontZ Angle 3"" delivers. It puts out sound that's clear and foot-tappable. and even at 100% volume, there's no distortion. But I had to turn it down; it was too loud. It's now set at about 75% of its maximum volume, and that's enough to defeat the HVAC, even when I'm at the distant end of the room. I'm planning to buy a second unit for my home.PS.

I hadn't looked for dimensions before I placed the order, so be advised. So, from the small size, I don't get much stereo separation.I've powered it on and paired it to Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit, this took about 15 seconds start to finish using Blueman and choosing this as an Audio Sink. Pairing was very quick and easy, the first pairing was the only attempt because it was successful.Listening to DJ Basilisk - Circadian Rhythms and Heliocentric. So, how is the bass response? Low frequency roll-off is substantial, despite designer efforts for good bass (bottom surface is a PASSIVE bass radiator... openings are over half of the bottom surface area). Very strong high frequency output. This device will need substantial EQ work. Total peak sound level is high, but at that level, the distortion is also high.Can't speak to battery life, I'm testing it using the charge which  it had from the factory. It is labeled for 5V 1 Amp, comes with a USB to Micro cord of about 18 inches. This Oontz does not come with a charger. Manual claims 6 hours to fully charge and 12 hours play time at 2/3rds volume.Water resistance is IPX5, which the manual says is splash resistance only, no puddles, do not submerge.Manual does not describe any other uses than as a stereo speaker.""Crystal Clear Stereo Sound"". Uhhh, no. Very little channel separation, left driver is 3/8"" from the right driver, my ears are spaced further apart than that. Each ear hears both left AND right.Is it worth the money?

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great size, easy to connect, no tech issues or errors.  Overall, the sound is great and this speaker gets loud without any problematic distortion at high volumes. I found the mids a bit too strong (though they are clear) and the bass to be lacking. The treble seems about right - perhaps a bit bright but definitely not harsh.  I'm not sure how people can say this thing has good bass, even for its size.  I was not expecting much bass at all from this speaker given it's size, but there are comparable speakers out there that do have more bass (e.g. jbl core, anker soundcore). However, those speakers come at a higher price point and often the sound is more directional and fire sound forward, not up or 360 degres around. Plus, the bass in other speakers often comes with more distortion at higher volume levels.  For this speaker's intended use for me, I'd rather have clear, loud sound than more bass that sounds bad when cranking the volume up.The build quality on this unit is just great.So overall, for the price, I'm pretty pleased. I didn't want to spend too much money on a speaker like this.  If it somehow had a touch more bass I'd give it 5 stars.

While it lacks the power and obviously size to reproduce high fidelity audio it does a surprisingly good job considering the odds stacked against it. Definitely one of the best Bluetooth speakers in this price point which is pretty reasonable. Is it a couple hundred dollar Bose or something along those lines? No but for the price its a dang good little speaker.Update 8/24/19Our first one is still going strong and we have purchased a second. The sound quality definitely is better when using the 3.5 mm connection but the volume definitely seems lower.

Took like 15 seconds for me to figure out how to connect it! Because it's waterproof we can leave it on our patio all the time too. We obviously have super high humidity and torrential downpours all the time so I don't have to worry about this. When we're ready to party all i have to do is turn it on and put the play list on! Plus you seriously can't beat the cost!

3.0 out of 5 stars,"It was becoming quite tedious to unplug and plug my speakers every time I wanted to listen to music in another room. Therefore, I wanted a wireless speaker that I could easily grab around the house, for when Im taking a shower, cooking, working, etc.This speaker does the job. However, the sound quality is nothing to boast about, its basically louder and slightly better than my cellphone (I have an iphone5), which is not great for a speaker. Anytime I play anything with something of a bass, or high note/pitch, these speakers do not play it super well and there is slight distortion.My other speaker which was not wireless where just basic desk top speakers, and somehow the sound played better out of them..In essence, this speaker does the job. The ease of moving these around and the ok price tag, makes me keep them and accept the sometimes distortion of sound.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's roughly the size of a 6 week old Persian cat (smaller breed) or a 4 week old Scottish Fold. This baby purs but not the sound of a fur ball enjoying the warmth of your lap. The Oontz Angle 3 plays mostly music. Pretty manageable in general, solid range, dexterous, and holds up well in sunlight. I put this bad boy in the bottom of my tub filled with water for over 12 hours. Well it didn't work after so I bought another and tried 8 hours. That one also broke so I bought a third and tried 6 hours. Same thing so dropped it to 4. This time it held up and worked after so I tried 5 and it died. Drew the line below 5 above 4. So there's your marker if you are looking to drop it in the lake for a bit although I'm not sure why you would want to do that. If that is your goal maybe find an under water speaker and don't rely on this you weirdo.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I like this speaker.  I bought it because it was cheaper than similar speakers.  It's a good looking portable speaker and it doesn't draw a lot of attention to itself.  I think I generally get 8-10 hours of play time from it, depending on how loud I have it set.  This is enough playback time for me.  It feels light and well built. Connecting via bluetooth is easy and simple.  The reason it receives three stars is sound quality.  It can be a little muddled at mid-volume.  I'm not looking for perfection from a small, cheap speaker but my old Bem speaker did a better job at moderate volume.  Granted, this is all based on personal preference so it might sound fine to you.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this in July, and was initially very pleased with the sound, either cabled or bluetooth, the portability, and toughness/waterproof characteristics.  So, after a few months, scratch the ""toughness"" aspect, because like others have noted, and with SO many other products out there, the USB port is mechanically flimsy and after repeated use fatigues and fails.  Why Cambridge Soundworks, like so many other manufacturers, insist on employing USB when all it's used for is power, is beyond me.  Great sound and battery life for the price, but if it's only going to last 3 months I would expect Cambridge Soundworks to take some heat for the number of these things that will be littering the landfills in short order.EDIT:  From 1 Star, to 3.  Based entirely on the response and support from Cambridge Soundworks. (see the comments to this review).  Cambridge Soundworks acted quickly to this issue, and offered a replacement unit.  I received it less than a week ago.  3-Stars from 1 is a good bump.  But the replacement unit has the same somewhat flimsy USB port for charging the unit, so I'm withholding a better rating until I see how this one holds up.  I also asked about disposal of the original but haven't rec'd. an answer to that question; if these thing are basically disposable that would be horrific, since I'm pretty sure that whatever these are made of has no business being in a landfill or the oceans.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have only had this speaker one day so I don't have a lot of run time with it.  Here's what I've discovered.  I've tried it with my MacBook Air, iPad, iPhone and HP Spectre. The Bluetooth function pairs quickly with all of my devices.  I also have a Bose SoundLink and the OontZ connects even quicker.  The problem I have is when using it with my MacBook connected to an external monitor.  Then the Bluetooth not only sounds awful with a lot of static, it also interferes with the signal and cuts out the video.  However, if I use the 3.5mm audio cable, it works just fine. The reason I bought this is that MacBooks cut out the sound when using an external monitor.  So you need a speaker like this.  I'm OK with the cable,  just would have preferred using the Bluetooth.It appears to be well constructed.  Haven't run down the battery yet to see how long a charge will last.  It's very easy to set up.  I like it's small size - doesn't take up much space on my desk.  The sound quality is very good for a small speaker - not as good as the Bose, but certainly adequate.  And for the price, it's a pretty good deal.I'll update my review after I get more experience with the speaker.Update March 20, 2019I've now been using this speaker for about 3 weeks and have seen no significant changes.  It works well in Bluetooth mode with all of my devices except my MacBook Air where it has a lot of static.  It does work just fine with the MacBook Air when using the 3.5 mm cable. I've tried it with my wife's MacBook air and my daughter's MacBook air and get the same static in Bluetooth.  So, it's not just my computer.  Other than that, it's a good value for the money.  Seems to be holding up well.  After three weeks of constant use, I still have not had to recharge it.  So, battery life is great.

To skip a song, you will have to do it at the sound source.Notes:1) Water resistant means: splash resistant,  do not submerge in water.2) Can not be used to charge other devices.3) Will play while charging.4) I tested id about 30' away from the source and it works great.5) When an incoming call comes, the music will pause and will resume after the call is ended.6) Comes with an audio aux cable and charging cord.7) For the size and price the sound quality is outstanding. Want a huge sound? Get a home stereo.8) Can be used anywhere as long as you have your Bluetooth streaming device nearby.9) If shooting, cutting wood, driving a truck with open exhaust, riding a racing boat or flying a Cessna, you may not hear it clearly!10) No Bass/Treble adjustment but you should be able to do that in you device.Love it!

I tried it again after a few months, and it worked.  A few months later, same thing.  I went through the ""hard reset"" steps listed on the manual and got it to connect, but no audio (I could use the Play/ Pause button on the speaker, but that was all).In general, I think I got what I paid for: a cheap, low-quality speaker that sounds pretty good when it feels like working.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered this and everything was perfect.I used it on top of the showcase when we had mini parties and when I cooked. Great sound and battery. Recently. I tried using it around Christmas and the sound was terrible, like mono. So I figured it was the batteries because it was very low. I fully charged it, and tried again twice, but the battery does not charge very well and even when the battery is charged, it doesn't last. The worst part, the speaker sound is officially busted. It sounds like something from the intercom system back during the war times as seen in movies. The only time I brought it down from the showcase is to charge the batteries, which I would say is no more than a handful because battery did last really well on one charge, and I use it like once a week or every other week for maybe half hour at most. Now it doesn't even charge well and the charge doesn't hold past half hour. Very disappointing because I really liked this while it lasted. I bought this in the summer so it lasted me about 6 months before the speaker busted. Two stars because I did love it before it died.***Update:I just want to say customer service is EXCEPTIONAL. I wish I had reached out to them before I left a poor review, but they reached out and replaced my speaker. I have not yet used it, but I am sure it will be fine because like I said in my previous review, I had loved the speaker even before it died. Thank you so much for following up. A 5-star review is well earned.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I wanted this to play audio from my Alexa Echo dot and it does. It was a little tricky connecting it the first time but after that as long as you pair it with the Alexa command and then start playing the audio it works good.  I paired it with my phone too but tried to raise the volume with the plus key and it skipped to the next song.  I don't like that the power button is invisible and hard to find.  I don't like that you can't tell how much charge it has left.  I wish it had like 5 dots that lit up and went down for every 20% of power left.The sound is very good, even loud it's not distorted.  I like to hear news channels from Tune in when I'm in the shower and my bathroom has a fan that turns on when I turn the light on and I can barely hear my tablet when that happens, but with this I can hear it even when the fan and shower is running.  It's also good that it's splash proof in case I drip on it while I'm toweling off.  I also like that you can turn it off and then Alexa disconnects and I can hear the audio in my living room thru the echo dot.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"This angle 3 pretty much lives up to the description. The sound quality is excellent, the battery is great, and I like the style. Unfortunately, they put the audio-in port right next to the power port. This means if you're using your unit in analog audio mode AND you're charging, you get significant output noise, even when no audio is playing. It's a real bummer. To make the line noise go away, either don't charge the unit, or use only bluetooth.Speaking of bluetooth, this unit does not play well with non-premium brand bluetooth. Yes, it's great for iPhone. But, for Android and PCs with bluetooth, audio quality may stutter, and connectivity may suddenly fail.Really, the OontZ Angle 3 is meant to be used with premium equipment. I would have eliminated the audio in aux port, and simply required the latest bluetooth without any version compatibility fallback. For those of us who want to use an Oontz in a desktop PC environment, we should look elsewhere.

You can get the Amazon basics small black speaker and it's pretty good for 20 bucks, poor quality on the high end for sound and little to no low end base to speak of...but still good.This however is a great purchase for the money. It's not water proof so if you want that buy and Altec....Life Jacket is a solid purchase and has crazy battery life not to mention has a construction of a fall out bunker....but is also about 3 to 4 × as much money.Sooo in closing if you want a good medium range speaker for and office or garage get this little guy you won't be sad....that being said it better not break in a week.****Update the sound comes out at about 25 to 35% higher and clearly better quality when connected through BT.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this on a whim because I needed a wireless speaker but I didn't want to spend a lot of money and this speaker really exceeded my expectations. The battery lasts quite a long time especially if you're not at full blast. The sound quality itself all the way up from low to high is really good. It isn't the loudest speaker in the world, I tried to hear it over my snowmobile and it wasn't happening but I wasn't expecting to be able to either. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's annoying to tell whether or not it is on or off making Bluetooth connection a hair frustrating. Sometimes it makes a on noise sometimes it doesn't. But other than that it is a great little speaker for in the woods, working on a car, or at work. Oh and I was able to hear it pretty well at a large skate park but there were only a handful of people there making noise. And I've had this speaker for a few months now so I am not just getting to use this thing like many of the reviews here

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an excellent speaker for listening to audiobooks. The sound quality is rich and deep, which helps you hear the voices even if they are muffled or high-pitched. The buttons are soft and easy to push and locate. It also has a decent speaker phone. The small size and flexibility (horizontal or vertical) make it easy to set anywhere as I move around. Since the the volume between the speaker and the phone are independent there is a great deal more flexibility with volume. It can be very loud when I’m gardening. And very quiet when I’m falling asleep. The sleep timer also comes in very handy. After the timer turns off my audiobook, the speaker turns  off after 15 minutes of no activity. Awesome!  It’s very comfortable to carry around. I also love that it’s Bluetooth connection signal is quiet and pleasant. The water resistance is also very handy if I need to touch it while doing the dishes. I highly recommend this speaker for audiobook listeners!

After using this speaker for about a month, I have come to the conclusion that there is no way almost 36,000 people would give this 4.5 stars; something is amiss.  I should have followed the adage of ""if it's too good to be true, it probably isn't"". In this case, the reviews are not close to reality.I purchased this speaker hoping to save a few bucks over the cost of another speaker like the Wonderboom speaker another member of our family has.  I was immediately disappointed in this OontZ Angle 3 for two reasons.  Most importantly, the sound produced by the speaker is no better than the sound produced by my I phone 8.  There is very little base sound and ""tinny"" overall sound is VERY disappointing. I don't consider myself a sound aficionado, nor do I consider myself a speaker snob; I just want a good full sound from a speaker.  Also, this speaker's volume is only able to be controlled by the phone so if the phone is not immediately available, there is no way to lower, or increase, the volume.Save yourself don't waste your hard earned money on this lame excuse for a bluetooth speaker.

I noticed a problem as I charged the speaker - the connection between the cord and the speaker was very loose, basically it cannot stay connected, I had to use something (e.g. a pillow or a book)  to hold it to stabilize it to charge it. As showed on the picture, the cord cannot stay straight, it tilts down.Since I wasn't an experience online shopper at the time, I just decided to continue using it that way. Until this Thursday, it cannot be turnned on completely.I liked the quality of the sound, that's why I gave two stars instead of one, but no matter how much I loved the sound, I'll have to shop another one after only one year of using it along all the troubles I had during this time.Was it only my bad luck?

Probably drives my neighbors (multiple acres away) with the extreme quality these little speakers (there are two) pour out!!

Alright, I never intended to abuse it, but it's my only music speaker, but not sadly, this little thing rocks! The battery stays charged for days if you turn it off at night and even if you don't and it dies-just plug it into the charger and it play immediately-and charges at the same time. I have plugged it into my laptop for MP3 tunes....phenomenal. I keep thinking, I should get another one, but this little thing plays so well, I have to turn it down just to realize someone has come over to visit!

One out of three is not great.Build quality is pretty good.  Sound quality is, meh, average, not earth shattering but then for the price it is rather over sold.  Let's not pretend it's anything but sub-par sound.However, the reliability of the unit is not good.  I am on my second one now and it suffers the same issue the first one did and others seem to of complained about.  Randomly, the unit will cause the sound stream to pause, restart itself and now you have to manually start the stream again.  No other Bluetooth Audio device I've owned has ever exhibited this problem and shouldn't.  Since this second one has the same problem (I tried both my iPad, iPhone and PC Laptop, all same problem) I will now return it and find another brand that doesn't over hype itself then fall very short.

I bought this on a whim while it was on sale - and it turned out to be a great decision.I have been using a JBL Flip 4 in my office to listen to music, podcasts, etc. on a low volume while working at my desk.  The one major downside to the JBL Flip 4 is that every time I turn it on or off, the 'connect', 'disconnect' and 'power on' and 'power off' sounds are VERY LOUD and they cannot be altered (at least not that I've found) and it is distracting to others.The OontZ has clear sound, it's small footprint and size are perfect for my application, the connection sound is not distracting or loud and the Bluetooth works flawlessly.  I haven't listened to anything at a moderate or loud setting yet so I can't comment on sound quality beyond a volume setting of '4'.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and I would buy it again.  It's a great speaker that is very intuitive to set up and very easy to use!

Now, the asking price for the Angle 3 is about 1/3 to 1/4 of the JBLs, but is only a few bucks more than the Sony. And while sacrificing solid bass and scooped mids, what those few dollars exactly gets you is twofold: Volume and battery life. The Oontz has a great battery (a dozen or more hours, vs the XB01's 5-6hrs)! And it's quite a bit louder to boot.You may be asking, ""Why did you give it 4 stars then?"" Well, I didn't exactly get it for music listening. My purpose for this speaker is to use at my couch with a DIY synthesizer setup (a Gakken SX-150mkII, hacked with a custom-built 400mm softpot controller, into a Zoom effects pedal), and in that capacity it works amazingly well. It's funny how intended use can influence desired outcome!All in all, had I bought the Oontz Angle 3 to use for listening to music, I likely would have returned it and put that credit toward a better (albeit more expensive) option. But for the reason I bought it, it is good enough if not great, especially considering what I paid.The questions I'd ask you to ask yourself are these: ""Am I shopping for something to use with my phone's Prime/Spotify/etc. streaming?"" and, ""Can I swing forty to fifty bucks more for a speaker that just plain sounds better?"" If the answer to either or both of these is ""Yes,"" then I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a compact BT speaker.But I like the Angle 3 nonetheless.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am not crazy about the Oontz Angle 3.  I have had the Oontz Angle for several years and liked it's operation, still use it!  So when I needed a second speaker, I went straight to the Oontz line.  What I don't like about this design is mostly due to making it water resistant.  The buttons and connections have been relocated to the upper corner on the back.I generally use this with audio cable because the charge on my nano lasts longer than when using bluetooth.  The audio cable connection is not a good location on that top back corner, it sticks out and is in the way.  (much better when located at the bottom of the back).The on/off button is hard to push as it is small and covered with the waterproof material.  The Oontz Angle has more of a sliding on/off switch which is easier to use.The sound with the audio cable is not as loud as it is on my original Oontz Angle.  However, if you use the Angle 3 with bluetooth you DO get the expected volume of sound with this speaker.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, I bought this item quite a while ago (over a year ago), but I figured I'd leave a quick review of it now. Overall, for the money, this is an excellent little speaker. I use it in a very limited fashion. Basically, it's my bathroom (specifically SHOWER) speaker: I take this speaker into the shower with me, and set it on the ledge (it doesn't get wet from the shower there, but it's exposed to lots of humidity, and my wet hands), and use it to listen to NPR in the mornings. That's it. And for this purpose, it's great. Meets my needs perfectly. I chose this speaker because it has great clarity on vocals, and doesn't have TOO MUCH bass, like some speakers from the more major manufacturers. For example, I also have the JBL Charge 3, but it has WAY too much bass for this purpose. I also had the JBL Clip 2, which had the same problem. The Oontz Angle 3, despite its claims of ""Rich Bass"", I find to be more well-balanced, and I specifically bought it BECAUSE it doesn't have too much bass. It's very durable (mine has met with the floor several times, and is still going strong, even a year later), is waterproof, and has great sound for my specific needs. And it's incredibly affordable! I would buy another one if I needed it, but I don't. Not yet, anyway. So, I actually can't offer an opinion of how this speaker performs with music. But for talk radio & podcasts, I found it to be excellent, and great value for money.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"My first impression is the speaker is very solid and well made.  It's smaller than another bluetooth speaker I have, but as I began testing, the sound is just as loud and even better quality.  I tested it with Metallica and AC/DC and it played the highs and lows and the bass with no distortion !!!I tested some of the specs that were given like the range of 100 feet for the bluetooth connection.  I didn't have a measuring tape, but I had the music playing from my laptop in the basement and the speaker on the 2nd floor still playing without issue.  I went to the deck which has to be 60 feet away, again no problem.When the speaker arrived it had a charge and I began using.  Then overnight I charged up completely and used over an entire weekend.  I had a major project to do downstairs and had it playing for at least 8 hours Saturday and Sunday.  It just kept on working.The instruction guide is straightforward and helpful to understand all the features.I highly recommend this speaker for a great price and many great features.I hope this provides some helpful information and would appreciate the click on Yes !!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great little speaker.  Sound quality and volume is better than I would have expected from so small a device, but I still consider it a personal speaker.  Putting it on speakerphone at a table with about 5 people definitely strained its capability.  Spreading out anymore and we would have had trouble hearing the conversation and being heard on the mic.  Using it in the bathroom is excellent however.  I have generally used it in the shower several times a week for the last 2 years.  Plenty loud enough, with headroom to spare.  It has survived plenty of splashing and wet hands.  And, battery life is great.The only annoyance is when I play audiobooks.  Oftentimes the reader will pause between paragraphs or sentences.  If the pause is long enough, the speaker appears to ""sleep"" to save battery.  Waking back up takes less than a second, but is long enough that it will often miss the first word of sentences or paragraphs.  Some books are much worse than others (depending on the reader).

My kids can easily turn it on and off. My toddler has dropped it a bunch of times and it still works.

It's a ~$25 bluetooth speaker so that must be considered.The bluetooh connectivity is OK. There is some delay that's a little annoying on the phone and the bluetooth loses connection if not in use for a period of time. I actually bought this so that I could use it with my iPhone to answer calls while sitting on the sofa. I'm a bit disappointed in that because I have to reconnect the bluetooth when someone calls, if it hasn't been in use for awhile. I guess that's understandable because if it were ""ON"" all the time, the battery wouldn't last long.Still....... for a $25???? Really? What does one expect? I had to give it 5 stars.................... so far.............. I'll edit this if anything changes.

I had a full-size woofer/tweeters for decades, but it finally quit on me.This tiny, 6"" long, inexpensive one-piece (INCLUDING 4"" WOOFER) gives great sound, though of course true stereo ambiance is lacking.

Not submersible, though - the bottom is open to let the bass out, so I imagine it wouldn't be good to sink it in any water.A really big plus for me was how nice the quick start guide was! I was expecting a poorly translated, mildly confusing sheet of paper, but it's several pages and in clear, correct English.

Clear for the voices and news. Music sounds good. For a small speaker, great quality and volume.Now, the only negative.It is re-chargeable and turns off after 5 minutes of no use if no connection. EXCEPT, it does NOT turn off when hooked up to Alexa. The instructions clearly state that the auto turnoff does not work with the Alexa.So, if using it with the Dot or Alexa system, you have to turn it off manually after use. Or, the speaker will stay on until the battery dies.Not a big deal, It does immediately hook up with Alexa through blue tooth when turned on. But, it would be nice if they could fix that issue.

The corners are protected and the it has soft feet to keep it where you place it.The sound quality is pretty amazing for such a small speaker.  It is not going to rattle the windows with huge bass but has enough bass to keep the sound from being thin and tinny.  The mids and highs are acceptable, given the price point.  I was pretty impressed with the amount of noise this little speaker makes.  Again, for the money invested, it does a good job.The most impressive part of the Oontz, for me, is the battery life.

In other words if the power button just barely bumps into anything it turns on. I constantly have to open my backpack and dig it out (which is hard to do because my backpack is pure black, and I can't see the speaker against the pure black) and turn it off multiple times a day because I hear it turn on. The volume level is ok, and certainly a big improvement over an iPhone or ipad's volume limit, but if you want something really loud, this isn't the unit for you. For that you might need a BTS that plugs in. Battery life is actually pretty good if you only use it on occasion like I do. I can go a week or two without recharging it (but I only use it for a few minutes here and there, I use it primarily as part of my work, not for recreational listening).

I'm not sure why there would be a difference between my phone and the monitor's volume projections. There must be some disconnect with the monitor and speaker's compatibility. I don't have a newer monitor to try it on, but it's possible that my (several year old) monitor doesn't work great with this technology.The speaker great for the price, and really does work perfectly when connected with my phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Update - I have owned this speaker for two years now. It still sounds great.  I am still amazed at the sound that comes from this compact speaker.If you are wondering if the reviews are to good to be true STOP WORRYING and buy this speaker before Cambridge SoundWorks realizes they priced it too low.I was trying to find a new Bluetooth speaker for my wife as a birthday gift. The Logitec that we owned for several years just didn't sound like it used to. In addition to the Bluedio BS-3 I also purchased the Cabridge SoudWorks OontZ Angle 3, and the UE Roll (1st Generation). If you are wondering, the Cambridge SoundWorks had the best sound in my opinion regardless of price.When we received all three speakers my wife insisted I participate in a blind listening test. I am a cheap skate and she was convinced I would favor the cheaper speaker (she did not know the prices when we listened to them). We found an article online with song recommendations for testing speakers and headphones. We listened to Caribbean Blue by Enya (not a fan but a good song to test the speakers), Brass Monkey by Beasty Boys, and Unfinished Sympathy by Massive Attack. I also added Falling Slowly from the Once soundtrack as it has good female and male vocals in the same song, as well as acoustic guitar.ResultsBluedio BS-3 - This speaker was easily identified as the 3rd Place speaker. While it sounded fine there was not a single song I listened to where it stood out. The one area where I felt this speaker excelled was in volume. You could leave this speaker on the kitchen counter and hear it clearly in the living room 30 feet away. The only negative was a constant soft static sound in the back ground. If I had not been comparing side by side I might not have noticed it. Had this speaker been less expensive than the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angel 3 I might have considered it.UE Roll (1st Generation) - The UE Roll was a very good speaker and definitely a good value at $67. My wife and I did not share our opinions with each other as we progressed through the listening test. The amazing thing was that we both had identical thoughts about all three speakers. Our first impression was that the UE Roll had the best sound. However when we narrowed it down to the a head to head contest with the Oonz Angle 3 we realized it had very different sound from the other speakers. The only way I can describe it is that the Roll sounds like it is under a thin lid. There is a slightly muffled echo aspect to the sound. The more I listened, the more I noticed, and I did not like it. Again had I purchased this speaker on its own I would have liked it just fine. It is also possible mine was a one off for UE.Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3 - When I told my wife that this speaker was only $30 she didn't believe me.Seriously how is this speaker $30!!! She has a Bose speaker in her office at work. This speaker is no where near as good as the Bose, but my wife appreciates good sound. The Oontz Angle 3 sounds great. The funny thing is that I almost eliminated it from consideration listening to Brass Monkey because I thought it had a harsh sound to it. I later realized that it was just the jarring differences of the UE Roll. The Roll's slightly muffled sound made the Angle 3 sound harsh in comparison.If you are looking for a Bluetooth speaker under $100 the Cambridge SoundWorks Oontz Angle 3 is a great choice. The best part is that it is only $30!!!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Really happy with this speaker overall. I bought it primarily based on price and the water resistance rating. This is for use outdoors, and I didn't want to kick myself if I accidentally left it outside overnight.Pros:- Great build quality. It feels really solid.- Volume is impressive for such a small speaker.- High range is very clear.- Bluetooth pairing is super fast, maybe takes 2 seconds at the most.Cons:- I was not impressed with the bass, as some other reviewers seem to have been. It's mostly non-existent.- Mid-range sounds a bit muddy at times.One minor personal gripe: I wish the micro-USB was a bit more recessed under the rubber seal. I use cables with interchangeable, magnetic tips so I can charge everything with the same cable. Unfortunately, I can't put one of the micro-USB tips in the port because it would cause the cover to stay open. It's not a dealbreaker, and most people probably won't care.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wasn't expecting too much for the price point here but it definitely exceeded. The angle is pretty en-genius. I like to point my smaller bluetooth speakers toward the wall or any flat surface because the sound seems to bounce back louder. I normally have to place something under the front of a speaker to give it an upward angle to maximize the affect. This speaker already has the angle so this works particularly well. Most speakers I have bought in the past that have good bass seems to come at the cost of a decent midrange sound. This speaker has plenty have bass and seems balanced with treble and mid as well. Which is great if you ever listen to anything other than rap. Doesnt get distorted at max volume either. I really liked the doss touch wirless v4.0 bluetooth speaker and got on to purchase another but after seeing the reviews on this one decided to give it a try. They are extremely close in sound quality but have to give the win to the OontZ angle because is smaller, so easier to travel with. It also seems a little bit less distorted at max volume than the doss. (the doss may have a tiny bit more bass but not much at all) Overall a great design and great sound at an unbeatable price.

So when I moved into my own place, I didn't know how much I wanted to invest. I figured that I'd start small and go from there. I'm SO glad I did.This speaker is crazy powerful, but small. It turns off by itself if you're not using it, which is a huge plus because I constantly forget to turn stuff off (yikes). A full battery charge lasts four to five days, even if you are using it 12 hours (about my usage). And it will tell you if it needs a charge by flashy a red light at you. It's not annoying or anything, but not subtle either.The reasons I took a star off: the aux cord that came with it will absolutely break (it's short anyways) plus the blutooth capabilities are meh.I had actually bought an extra auxiliary cord because I knew I would want a much longer cord, which I did. Ended up being a wise choice when the one that came with the speaker broke. And even if my phone is within a foot of it, the blutooth cuts out. Which sucks, but isn't a real issue for me.Tldr; Besides a couple of forgivable flaws, totally worth it.

I highly recommend this. It has a long lasting battery, excellent sound, great volume and a better value than comparable speakers costing more. I have tried Altec Lansing, Bose and Anker, and I thought this one sounded much better.  Although, the Anker was a close competition.  I was steered away from that one because of connectivity and battery life issues from the one I tested.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"First I need to state how I'm using this device, my hearing is damaged by 60% on the right side and 80% on the left, so I need a bluetooth speaker right next to me to hear without blasting the TV.At first I didn't like it at all, the delay of signal was very distracting and sounded like a poor echo system, but after talking to their customer service people and doing a little research myself, I found that the latency of any bluetooth device has always been there, I just happened to hook mine up in a way that allowed me to really hear it at it's worst.Once I had all the facts I simply needed to plug this transmitter into the external speaker jack which muted the speakers of the TV (not the aux audio out) and the echo effect was gone, yes there is a slight delay that you can see the actors lips do not match what we see, but that's a small price to pay for having the sound right next to me and the speaker I use this speaker with a TaoTronics bluetooth transmitter plugged into the external speaker jack on the back of my Sony 65"" TV, works great.

Cure: purchased a Bluetooth transmitter for my SONY TV and used my Bluetooth earbuds. Problem ... had to take earbuds out to talk and wife couldn't hear. Purchased this speaker as a substitute. It's next to us and voice from streamed media is much clearer, especially when competing with loud background music (eg. Star Trek Discovery) or low spoken dialog (eg. Handmaiden's Tale). It's been a week. So far, so good.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I just opened and fired it up so I can’t attest to the battery or this device’s longevity, but I can say this:1.  I turned it on and paired it to my phone, which took literally 3 seconds, and it started to play.  Ive had lots of Bluetooth speakers and none connected as painlessly as this one - it just worked.2.  The sound coming out of this device is impressive.  It’s about the size of a soda can, prism shaped with eased edges (no pointy corners).  The lows are better than you’d expect, and mids are good.  I’d prefer crisper highs but overall the sound is better than the Bose which costs 3 Xs as much, is 50% bigger, and is difficult to connect to my phone.  It’s as good as the boom 3 which costs 6 Xs what I paid for this one.3.  It’s pretty loud.  You’d expect a tiny speaker to max out long before this does.  There is a little distortion when it’s cranked all the way up, but not at all what you’d expect from these little speakers pushed betond their sweet spot.For 1/4 of $100, this little guy is amazing so far.

If you don't want to spend much money in a bluetooth speaker like bose or beats for 199$ or more so the cambridge is the best choice. You won't dissapointed with it. I wonder how a mini speaker can provide a such sound. I have even used it for a little party at home and all my friends cannot beleive the sound provided from this mini monster speaker.Also noted the battery is correct so i highly recommend this speaker.In mine i add an apple logo because i am a fan so...i am in love of this speaker.

It's small enough to not take up too much room but the sound quality is great.  I used it for about 5 hours last week and I have used it 5 days in a row at work - all day long - and I have just had to charge it today for the first time.  I am very impressed with the battery life.  I would definitely recommend this to others.  I had no issues connecting or staying connected with Bluetooth either.  Great product for a reasonable price.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"With Cambridge SoundWorks you are always guaranteed excellent quality.  I have been using their products for decades and still have a big pair of home theater speakers that are running strong after 15 years.  This very little guy of a speaker is very impressive.  It is so tiny and obviously very easy to carry anywhere.  Of all the bluetooth speakers I have tried this was the most portable.  The ease of the bluetooth connection was a mere few seconds and it would immediately find its last source and be ready to play.  The sound quality at lower to mid levels is awesome with crystal clear clarity added with just the right amount of bass.  For me the sound did get somewhat muddled at the higher volumes.  The speaker is indeed loud but I found the clarity slightly sacrificed.  I play my speakers on the higher end in my apartment and have found others to provide better sound quality with the highs.  I am not sure if outside the highs may indeed work much better with this speaker.The biggest plus here with this speaker is ease of connection and its quality in that it is solidly built and durable while holding a constant connection.  It never breaks up in the slightest.  I also think when it comes to sound quality it is honestly a matter of preference.  Everyone plays different types and styles of music, wants different highlights in their music.  Some want more bass while some want an enhancement of vocals or treble.  This speaker is an amazing value with impressive built quality.  I can highly recommend it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker has incredible sound for its size. It connects easily between my laptop and iPhone. I haven't measured the battery life, but it exceeds my expectations. Its small size makes traveling with it easy. It doubles as a speakerphone, and I might add it's the best speakerphone I've used. The bluetooth range is great. When using as a speakerphone, I can leave my phone in my office and carry the speaker anywhere in the house with no interference or disruption. It's water resistant, so it is great to use in the shower. The controls are well placed and give you the ability to pause, skip, and of course adjust the volume. When switching between devices, you don't have to use the device it's currently connected to in order to disconnect. Just press the bluetooth button to disconnect and then connect on your other device. Even outdoors, it has powerful sound. Excellent product.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me preface this review by saying, I was provided a free sample for testing and review. I explained to the manufacturer that I would provide an honest review of this product. All experiences with this product and all opinions are solely my own.I purchased the prior generation of this speaker, the OontZ Angle Plus, so I'll be able to compare them. The Plus has crystal clear sound and good bass. I really enjoyed the Plus, but where the Plus needed some improvement was with its volume and bass.The new OontZ Angle3 significantly increases the volume and bass, but more importantly it retains and improves upon the crisp and crystal clear sound of its predecessor, plus it adds an ingenious bass design. More on that later.What's included in the package:1 - OontZ Angle3 Speaker1 - Micro USB Cable1 - 3.5mm Audio Cable1 - Quick Start GuideThe OontZ Angle3 is a great sounding Bluetooth speaker, in a small compact package. It weighs in at about 9 ounces. It is 5 1/4 inches long and about 2 1/2 inches high. It will basically fit in the palm of your hand. Please refer to the pictures I posted. It also retains the angular design of its predecessor, but now has a silicone rubber type finish on both ends of the speaker. It's still void of any sharp edges. It's a great looking speaker, with a unique design. I like this Angle3 design better than the Plus.It's significantly louder than the Plus and has nice bass, for a unit that's this small. If you enjoy music that has some bass, this unit should meet your needs and be truthful, the sound that comes out of this speaker is mind boggling to me and the size of this speaker belies that fact!The passive radiator, which produces the bass in the Angle3 and most Bluetooth speakers, is located on the bottom of the unit. If you place it bottom down, the bass effect is more pronounced. If you want a little less bass, you'll stand it on end. When it's bottom down, the bass has a nice little thump. I believe this was done by design and it's an ingenious feature.Be careful where you place the speaker bottom down, because it does want to move when playing music with bass. The speaker has pads on the bottom, but they work better on very smooth and glass surfaces.You can hear that Cambridge Soundworks spent the majority of its time improving and refining the sound of the Angle3. That focus on improving acoustics shows up big time in this tiny, but crystal clear and loud speaker.There's no distortion at max volume. The speaker has 10+ watts of peak power. It's now loud enough to fill up your backyard party with clear, great sounding music. My wife heard me playing music upstairs and she was in the garage. It's plenty loud!All my music testing was done using Spotify. Speaker was set to full volume and iOS volume was set two clicks from max, for most of my testing. I also tested both settings set to max.Bluetooth connectivity is super easy. It connects from one device to another effortlessly. I found you don't have to press a button on the speaker to pair it with a different device. I like intuitive functions and this one fits the bill. It also has a speakerphone function. You can play and pause your tracks from the device as well.The OontZ Angle3 doesn't have all the options others have. You don't get NFC support, a micro SD card slot or the ability to skip tracks using the speaker controls. There are other Bluetooth speakers that have these options, but if you value how well your music sounds over a myriad of options, this beautiful sounding speaker is for you.The Angle3 has an IPX5 certification, which makes it splash proof and dust proof. Great for the shower and other wet environments. Don't be afraid to shower with it or have it out in the rain. It can't be submerged in water with this IPX rating.Battery life is about 7 hours, at 60% volume. It will be less at higher volumes. This is definitely less than the Plus unit, which does 12-15 hours of use. You have to take into account that the battery is driving much more sound and requires that extra battery power. I personally like the trade off and all that's required is to charge the unit a bit more frequently. A battery status symbol shows up in my iOS devices.If you're like me and aren't interested in the all the above mentioned options, that you may never use and just want a beautiful sounding speaker that's main focus is perfecting and delivering crystal clear sound, than this speaker is an excellent option to consider.To me, the OontZ Angle3 has no real negatives to mention. You could quibble about having more features, but I really don't consider that a negative. I'd rather have a great sounding speaker, over more features. In my opinion, this is a great Bluetooth speaker for the price.The OontZ Angle3 is a very solid speaker, that now has outstanding volume and good bass. It retains and actually improves upon the crisp highs and strong mids of its predecessor. I like that Cambridge Soundworks is actually focusing on sound quality and not loading up on tons of features.I can highly recommend the OontZ Angle3.Thank you for reading my review.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"It was a bit smaller than what I expected, but it's a good personal speaker for at home use. The sound quality is really good for the price point but the volume could be louder. While it's a bit too quiet to really use as a ""party"" speaker, it's perfect for use around the house, shower, or with a few friends, and it probably wont upset the neighbors. Speaking of the shower, a feature that I really enjoy is that it's water resistant. I wouldn't take it in the shower with me, but it holds up nicely against steam or counter-top spills. It also seems to have better bass than most of the smaller bluetooth speakers that I've used. The wifi range is great, I'd say it can reliably reach about 100 ft, but I've not really had the opportunity to really test it's limits. I literally use this daily lol

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This little speaker has some amazing sound at this price point.I was expecting half as much sound from this thing and was very surprised as to how well it performed with bass heavy music (rap stations) to acoustics (70s rock, Yes, Classical guitar).+ At full volume, across a 15 x 15 room, it's quite distractingly loud and you'll have to talk loud to talk over the speaker.+ Battery life seems great so far, 2 charges in and it's lasted me several weeks or work out sessions and continue rocking out in the shower after.+ Bass is decent  on its own indoors. on certain surfaces, at the right angles, you can enhance the deepness of the bass. (In the bathroom, if I put one side up on the lip of the sink, the bass effect through the sink cabinet is deeper and fuller sounding)+ Bass is OK outdoors, but its not going to sound as rich as indoors.+ Can be used while charging.- not a whole lot of control options directly on the speakerI had a 20 year old Cambridge Sound Works PC speaker set that is no longer made that, sadly, finally stopped working. It was crystal clear and had excellent bass and while not as powerful bass as my new replacement speaker system, was definitely a richer, fuller sound rivaling my home theater.  I didn't realize/notice that the OontZ Angle 3 was also made by CSW until after i'd received it.  The brand holds up its name in quality, and at 24 bucks I was really surprised what it delivered.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"sound is great, loud, splash proof, and everything else the good reviews say are for the most part all true. But maybe I got a bad apple, so it won't get 1-star because I do believe I could be on the small percentage of casualties.I've had this speaker for about 6 months, use it about 1-4 times a month, and it's never gotten wet.One day it just quit taking/holding a charge. Plug it in and it shows charging, after a few hours of being plugged in it still wont turn on. Being out of warranty I went ahead and broke it down and starting testing the battery on my bench and determined the battery cell was just bad. Not the PCB that's wrapped up inside the skin of the battery (probably controls over charging, over heating, and whatnot) but the cell itself just up and quit.Luckily it was a 18650 size 3v battery which are available with leads and controllers already.This is the other annoying part and why it gets 2 stars. it's only the cheapest, lowest capacity 18650 around. 2000 mAh and NiMh. In today's world, why not something bigger or maybe even lithium? I would pay the extra $4 in cost difference in the end for a unit that could advertise higher quality components.So I scooped up a new cheap battery, a 4000 mAh 18650 with leads and board. Wired it up and now I've got twice the usable play time.If it would have lasted a whole year I would have probably considered it a 3-4 star unit. But 6 months of light use just doesn't cut it.

As far as the tight squeeze holds it in place, it is well balanced right there and makes holding the tablet and typing and listening to music though it a breeze.  If you have a Note 12.2 or a tab 12.2 you owe it to yourself to pair this speaker with that case. Literally wished I could bend the ears of just one designer at Cambridge and get them to build perfectly match ed speakers to attach to a variety of tablets where they just snapped on as easily as this inserts in the kickstand and holds in place.Absolutely better than the JBLflip , the JawboneJambox, and countless others I've lost thoughout the years. Who could have thought a better sounding,  better designed,  and better performing battery would also be one of the lesser expensive ones. Not to mention,  with it inserted in the case above the kick stand, far less chances of walking off without it!Next up,  with this one rocking like it does in a great small form,I have got to have the larger version to sit around the house and really blast out the neighborhood!i-Blason Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 Case / Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 Case - Armorbox Dual Layer Hybrid Full-body Protective Cover with Kickstand and Impact Resistant Bumpers (Black/Black)

4.0 out of 5 stars,"This speaker arrived on the first day of April in 2018. Product died in early March 2019. The company was willing to send me a replacement for the cost of shipping. I was miffed that this thing only has a year-long lifespan, because it seems wasteful that it becomes trash within a year. When I think about it, though, a $24 speaker that lasts a year is only $2/month. But their customer service was good, they responded quickly, and the replacement arrived quickly.The battery life is great at first, but within about nine months, it would only play about 3 hours on a full charge.Features I wish this thing had? A skip feature, so you could skip to the next song. A mute feature, since the ""pause"" button doesn't work with streaming video. Louder volume.I would say that the sound quality is okay - it's hard to hear quiet podcasts over the sound of my shower, even on the highest volume. If you need a speaker loud enough to blast at a party, this isn't the speaker for you. But if you just want to listen to music in your quiet house, and you're on a budget, this is a totally acceptable speaker.I probably wouldn't buy this speaker again. It is aesthetically pleasing, but light on features. The case is physically durable, but the components will not last.

My intent was to indicate the product is unacceptable despite my having given the product 5 stars for each of Amazon's 3 pre-determined  performance ratings.I initially purchased a device 12/2018. It failed a month or so later. The company immediately sent out a replacement. Now, after a similar time frame, the device has failed again. It has failed in the precise way as the first. Despite having a great sound, good battery time, good design...the company managed to spec crap when it came to the speaker's USB port. The connection between the male charging cord and female charging port is what has failed each time and in the precise same manner.I did not bother filing a warranty claim with the company since I'd just get another speaker that would fail in a month or two. I cannot emphasize how unfortunate the company's manufacturing decisions are regarding the USB connection. The speaker is excellent. If the company spent maybe two and a half cents more per speaker for a better USB mechanical connection, the product would indeed be as good as they stipulate vs. (currently) a waste of one's money.

Well, let me tell you that I originally bought this because I recently purchased an iphone case that is waterproof.  Sounds good, right?  Yes, but what I did not realize is that the sound would also muffle the speaker and microphone because the case is sealed tight to prevent water damage.  Now that I have this beautiful speaker with microphone, I plan on using it as a speaker so I can understand people better and they can understand me better.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this speaker first for the price and ratings. It helped prove that having a bluetooth speaker next to my chair in the living room made a huge improvement in my television viewing (as my audiologist had suggested). There was some latency though of about a half-second, so I did some homework about bluetooth transmitters, speakers and latency. First step was to swap out the transmitter connected to the television; it had aptX but hung behind the television with a short cord. Then I purchased the Shenen bluetooth 4.2 speaker and the Deripus bluetooth 4.2 speaker. Never got any sound from the Deripus other than the speaker telling me it was paired. The Shenen crackled so often with intermittent communications in the first hour that it was obviously not a long term solution (even for the night). So I hooked up the Cambridge OontZ. It paired easily, and the lag with the new transmitter is barely noticeable but acceptable. Very happy with the volume controls  (lowest volume on Shenen was way too loud for me and the rest of the family), and it has the bass I need (also missing from the Shenen).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This hoodie is awesome. Its fitted but not so tight its uncomfortable (I'm 5'5 and 125). The inside is soft. And the outside is comfortable. My biggest complaint with hoodies is always the fit and arm length and then that zippers dont hold up. The fit on this is perfect the arm length is long enough to go over the wrist and a little of my hands but not so long I have to roll it down. And the the zipper is good quality and does not catch (will post update in a bit to see if the zipper holds up).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the jacket. It’s pretty warm for a fall day. I got the medium and I’m 135lbs 36D.  It’s snug when zipped up but not enough to be uncomfortable.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality of the sweatshirt overall seems very good. The sleeves are long enough which I usually have an issue with, and inside seams soft and warm. I am however only giving 4 stars as it seems to run a bit smaller even than I thought. I normally wear a medium, and large that I ordered although wearable is going to be quite snug. Probably only be able to wear a tank or a cami underneath for it to be comfortable and also seems a bit short waisted, I am 5 10 and it hits right at the top of my jeans.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Awohol0103_mauvepink hoodie and unfortunately will be returning it. I am 5'4"" and 125 lbs and ordered a size medium, based on the reviews. The body and arms fit much looser than I expected, but the sleeves were still too short and I would have preferred the body of it to be longer too. If it was a little more slim fitting (as the pictures make it appear) and about 2 inches longer for both the sleeves and overall length, I would have really liked it. The fleece lining is very soft and it has a nice weight to it, just didn't provide the flattering fit I was hoping for.

I normally order a medium but since a lot of people were saying it ran a bit small I ordered a size up and it's perfect!! I like my sweatshirts a little more snug fitting.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfectly adequate light weight sweater, only issue is it tends to shed fuzzies and gets stretched out easily.

First, I bought the large. It fit, but snugly. I returned it for the xl, and it’s still fairly fitted, but with a little room. To me, it’s a perfect fit. If you prefer looser fitting hoodies, I’d recommend going two sizes up from your regular size.Update: I bought several more colors of this hoodie in xl. The black runs smaller than the rest, for some reason, and I have noticed some stitching flaws. Overall, still like these hoodies, though.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm overall pretty skeptical of amazon reviews. I've been burnt before where everyone is like 'this is great!' and it was so bad. I took a chance on this because it seemed like there was a consensus with the reviews - really soft, fit well, good quality - and it really is. It was exactly what I was looking for, medium thickness so you're probably not wearing it in the summer but warm enough that it feels like a hoodie. I got the yellow which is a really nice mustard/gold color and it truly is soft and fits well. Overall good quality for the price.It does run small. I wear a size 14 and I pretty consistently wear Larges but after reading the reviews I went up to XL and it's perfect. Definitely wouldn't have fit in a L.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"IT'S SO SOFT?? I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT AND I LOVE IT! The fit is a liittle bit smaller than I was expecting, but it's not too small! It's very fitted to a feminine figure which can be great! I went with a medium for the arm and shoulder length, cuz those were my exact sizes, and it fits like a glove. I'll probably go with a Large size for my next one because I like my clothes with just a bit of a loose fit, but the sizes seem to be pretty accurate!Also the color was a bit brighter than the photo, but that wasn't a problem for me, because I LOVE this color! I got it in ""aqua blue."" The one I received is more of a bright baby blue in person, whereas the photo is a bit more muted. If that matters to you, keep that in mind!IT ALSO PASSES THE ""HOOD TEST""--the hood is large enough to comfortable cover my entire head to just above the end of the bangs of my hair. It doesn't sit too far back/on the center of my head like some hoods I've dealt with, so I'm super happy!!

Wow, I could have purchased a 2X or 3X and either would probably still fit! This zips and doesn't ride up, bit I definitely would be wearing it over more than 1 thin base layer.This is a really well made hoodie. I ordered the charcoal color with thick drawstrings and am really impressed by the construction of this item. It is lightly fleeced inside, the cuffs are stretchy, and it's the perfect length for me. The zipper is a little sticky but I'm sure it'll get better with use, as it's solidly made.This hoodie is the perfect length for me but tall people may have some challenges with it.

No shrinking, fading or pilling. I have several lululemon hoodies of different thickness and I prefer this one most of the time to wear since it's easy to take care of and a great price! My luluemon hoodies require to be laid flat to dry and/or steamed. I love them but if one accidentally gets in the dryer, it shrinks and the material looks a little worn. This is a better buy in my opinion.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This hoodie is just as lovely as one I had before, and wore to death! The yellow is accurate to the picture, if not a little bit brighter. The second picture is an accurate portrayal of its rich, taxicab yellow. The fit is divine; very comfortable but still fitted and flattering like a favored top should be! It should be noted, though, that I am usually a size XL and I ordered a XXXL. The other reviews convinced me that I needed to go up 2 sizes for it to fit, and they were definitely right. The size options are confusing, and I couldn't be sure if the XXXL or the 3XL was the way to go. Ultimately I made the right choice. The images I included were me trying it on fresh out of the plastic, so I don't know how it will wash, but if the size or shape changes at all I will include an update. Right now it's perfect!My measurements are 41-35-45; I'm an XL, sometimes 1X t-shirt size, and a 17/18 pant size. Hope that helps you to decide!:)

4.0 out of 5 stars,"As many other reviewers mentioned there are some sizing issues with these hoodies. I went ahead and ordered a size up to the XL as suggested. The tri-striped burgundy/gray/charcoal hoodie fit perfectly but the two solid colored XL hoodies were baggy in the arms and middle. Returned those but kept the striped one and going to reorder the solid colors in size L. Happy with fabric quality and the way they fit my body. Hopefully no issues after washing, will update if needed.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"This jacket is super cute and I do love it EXCEPT the manufacture is way off on sizing!  If you normally wear a medium (like me) but buy large sweatshirts (like me) to be comfy - HEED  THE WARNING!  Buy this 2 sizes larger!  Many have posted this same advice and I'm solid on confirming this is TRUE.  The quality is great and it's well worth buying 2 sizes larger even though you are thinking this sounds nuts.  Your other option is to loose 40 lbs and stick with the medium.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect! It's the perfect level of warmness and solid material. I love that the hood is large too, most hoods on these jackets are too small to even use- not this one!

I added patches and studs to this one but I might buy another to have a plain one. I am 5'1"", 115lbs, 34B, petite and the small fit perfectly.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a quality hoodie; soft, well made, and colors are accurately advertised. The sizing will depend on your preference of fit. I normally wear a large, or 12, in tops. First, I bought the large. It fit, but snugly. I returned it for the xl, and it’s still fairly fitted, but with a little room. To me, it’s a perfect fit. If you prefer looser fitting hoodies, I’d recommend going two sizes up from your regular size.Update: I bought several more colors of this hoodie in xl. The black runs smaller than the rest, for some reason, and I have noticed some stitching flaws. Overall, still like these hoodies, though.

It was exactly what I was looking for, medium thickness so you're probably not wearing it in the summer but warm enough that it feels like a hoodie. I got the yellow which is a really nice mustard/gold color and it truly is soft and fits well. Overall good quality for the price.It does run small. I wear a size 14 and I pretty consistently wear Larges but after reading the reviews I went up to XL and it's perfect. Definitely wouldn't have fit in a L.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"IT'S SO SOFT?? I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT AND I LOVE IT! The fit is a liittle bit smaller than I was expecting, but it's not too small! It's very fitted to a feminine figure which can be great! I went with a medium for the arm and shoulder length, cuz those were my exact sizes, and it fits like a glove. I'll probably go with a Large size for my next one because I like my clothes with just a bit of a loose fit, but the sizes seem to be pretty accurate!Also the color was a bit brighter than the photo, but that wasn't a problem for me, because I LOVE this color! I got it in ""aqua blue."" The one I received is more of a bright baby blue in person, whereas the photo is a bit more muted. If that matters to you, keep that in mind!IT ALSO PASSES THE ""HOOD TEST""--the hood is large enough to comfortable cover my entire head to just above the end of the bangs of my hair. It doesn't sit too far back/on the center of my head like some hoods I've dealt with, so I'm super happy!!

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Like everyone has said, this runs SMALL. I am very pear shaped, wearing a 10/12 on top and 16 on the bottom. I wear a M in most cotton blend athletic wear tops (Champion, Nike, etc.) and wear a L in compression gear and higher end brands (Lorna Jane, Lululemon.)I ordered an XL, knowing that this item is not vanity sized. Wow, I could have purchased a 2X or 3X and either would probably still fit! This zips and doesn't ride up, bit I definitely would be wearing it over more than 1 thin base layer.This is a really well made hoodie. I ordered the charcoal color with thick drawstrings and am really impressed by the construction of this item. It is lightly fleeced inside, the cuffs are stretchy, and it's the perfect length for me. The zipper is a little sticky but I'm sure it'll get better with use, as it's solidly made.This hoodie is the perfect length for me but tall people may have some challenges with it.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"I REALLY LOVE this shirt. It's so soft, it's super adorable and it's exactly what I was looking for. BUT...I am between a size 4 and 6, and I'm a firm medium. Since it's a sweatshirt I decided to size up so it would have some extra room in it and for it to be a little baggy but sadly it's pretty small. I washed it and it shrunk even more, and I didn't even dry it. I'm sad it's too small, even though I sized up.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Color and size are perfect. Quality is great. Not to thick or thin. I'm 5'9""  (128lbs) with a long torso and arms and the hoodie sleeves and length are just right. It's not too loose or or tight. Note I did size up to make sure it wasn't too fitted based on reviews. I really love that the color is as pictured AND that the hoodie washes very well. No shrinking, fading or pilling. I have several lululemon hoodies of different thickness and I prefer this one most of the time to wear since it's easy to take care of and a great price! My luluemon hoodies require to be laid flat to dry and/or steamed. I love them but if one accidentally gets in the dryer, it shrinks and the material looks a little worn. This is a better buy in my opinion.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This hoodie is just as lovely as one I had before, and wore to death! The yellow is accurate to the picture, if not a little bit brighter. The second picture is an accurate portrayal of its rich, taxicab yellow. The fit is divine; very comfortable but still fitted and flattering like a favored top should be! It should be noted, though, that I am usually a size XL and I ordered a XXXL. The other reviews convinced me that I needed to go up 2 sizes for it to fit, and they were definitely right. The size options are confusing, and I couldn't be sure if the XXXL or the 3XL was the way to go. Ultimately I made the right choice. The images I included were me trying it on fresh out of the plastic, so I don't know how it will wash, but if the size or shape changes at all I will include an update. Right now it's perfect!My measurements are 41-35-45; I'm an XL, sometimes 1X t-shirt size, and a 17/18 pant size. Hope that helps you to decide!:)

5.0 out of 5 stars,"This hoodie is awesome. Its fitted but not so tight its uncomfortable (I'm 5'5 and 125). The inside is soft. And the outside is comfortable. My biggest complaint with hoodies is always the fit and arm length and then that zippers dont hold up. The fit on this is perfect the arm length is long enough to go over the wrist and a little of my hands but not so long I have to roll it down. And the the zipper is good quality and does not catch (will post update in a bit to see if the zipper holds up).

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like the jacket. It’s pretty warm for a fall day. I got the medium and I’m 135lbs 36D.  It’s snug when zipped up but not enough to be uncomfortable. The chest area is more snug than the sleeves. If you want more room I suggest a large, but know the sleeves will look larger as well. I recommend and would buy again.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"The quality of the sweatshirt overall seems very good. The sleeves are long enough which I usually have an issue with, and inside seams soft and warm. I am however only giving 4 stars as it seems to run a bit smaller even than I thought. I normally wear a medium, and large that I ordered although wearable is going to be quite snug. Probably only be able to wear a tank or a cami underneath for it to be comfortable and also seems a bit short waisted, I am 5 10 and it hits right at the top of my jeans.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased the Awohol0103_mauvepink hoodie and unfortunately will be returning it. I am 5'4"" and 125 lbs and ordered a size medium, based on the reviews. The body and arms fit much looser than I expected, but the sleeves were still too short and I would have preferred the body of it to be longer too. If it was a little more slim fitting (as the pictures make it appear) and about 2 inches longer for both the sleeves and overall length, I would have really liked it. The fleece lining is very soft and it has a nice weight to it, just didn't provide the flattering fit I was hoping for.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was really nervous ordering this sweatshirt because of the mixed reviews, however, I'm super happy with it!!! The material is really soft and cozy. It's also stretchy. I purchased the black/white/gray design with 'Love' printed on it and it looks exactly like the picture. I normally order a medium but since a lot of people were saying it ran a bit small I ordered a size up and it's perfect!! I like my sweatshirts a little more snug fitting. If I wanted it to be a bit looser then an XL would have been the way to go.Overall I'm extremely satisfied with this product and I'm already considering ordering a different style.

I wear an 8-10 and ordered a large,  but could’ve probably gotten away with a medium if I wanted a snugger fit.  The large is roomy and comfy. Overall, very pleased.

3.0 out of 5 stars,"Very dense and wordy. I thought the formatting was weird and hard to distinguish quickly at a glance what was introducing or motivating a new topic vs the worked examples for that section. Needed more distinct separation imo. Content wise it was adequate and the examples were good and diverse, however I am certain there are better introductory probability texts.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ignore the negative reviews. This IS the best textbook in the market for an introduction to probability for math undergraduates. Why? Glad you asked.1. Coverage of topics. It shows that the authors are also top researchers in the field. The theorems, examples, and exercises are chosen with a purpose. They know what's important to make advances in modern probability and what's old-fashioned. They are building a solid foundation on which students can develop more advanced probability.2. Rigor. Theorems and proofs are presented with adequate rigor. They explain as much as possible and present possible pitfalls (such as measure theoretic details) and hint at how to solve them.3. Probabilistic ideas. The proofs are presented with probabilistic ideas. I suspect this is the primary reason why some students find it difficult. They have never been exposed to probabilistic way of thinking. But this is what the textbook is supposed to train them. And it does it flawlessly.4. Statistical ideas. The book has plenty of statistics in it, for example, discussion on p-values. This is great. Plenty of probability concepts can be best communicated through statistical questions. If you have math and stat students in your class, they both get a lot out of it.I am so grateful to the authors for writing this textbook. This is miles ahead of any other textbook I have seen. We have adopted this book for our undergrad probability sequence successfully.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not the book you want to use to study for your class even though it is used for your class.The definitions, theorems or even examples are not really helpful to get an idea about the topics covered.Unlike many other good math textbooks, you will not get a clear understanding about the whole topics covered and will be more confused after reading. It's explanations are horrible and more confusing with vague symbols and letters. Professors find it hard to understand. Hilarious how it is for the basic Introductory and is so difficult to understand.The authors did terrible job with wording and sentence fluency so that it is understandable to them only but not to any others

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used a draft version of this book while in Prof. Seppalainen's class. This book writes an equation and then translates it into English. In a way, this book is why I can say I understood probability theory or math in general. It also got me over the notion that theoretical math isn't fun; it converted an engineer into a mathematician.I sincerely recommend this book! The examples were engaging and well-explained, and wherever there was an unintuitive step taken, it was expanded upon immediately after. I read this book cover to cover, and I thoroughly enjoyed every page, which I cannot say about any other textbook.
